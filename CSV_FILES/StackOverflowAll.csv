<p>It can be seen above that MATLAB has considered the value <code>2.2189e-05</code> bigger than <code>0.00077775</code>. I guess the reason behind it is, MATLAB compared <code>2.2189</code> with <code>0.00077775</code>. It is because the column is a string. In my calculation, <code>column 2</code> and <code>column 3</code> were double but when I concatenated them with a string <code>column 1</code> as  <code>'B'</code>, it became string.
I guess it might have a very easy solution if <code>2.2189e-05</code> stays as <code>0.00002219</code>. I try to change the <code>format</code> to <code>longG</code> but the problem still persists.
Can someone suggest any idea to deal with it?</p>

I've measured grey levels at different lighting levels, and now I'm trying to get a relationship for grey levels across an area to light sources across that same area.</p>
<p>So far I've been doing this in OpenCV and C++, based on a prior prototype in MatLab. Part of the solution in MatLab involves using a Quadratic Solver (the function <code>quadprog</code>), and I must admit to being a little out of my depth when it comes to Quadratic Programming. If possible I would really like to be able to implement this natively in OpenCV, so I don't have to use a different library, convert my Mats to its matrix standard, and then back to cv::Mats once more. Is there a way to do this natively? I have looked at the documentation for OpenCV solvers, but I'm not sure they're applicable in this case . . .</p>
<p>For reference, the MatLab I'm trying to implement looks like this, where H, F, A, B, LB and UB are matrices:</p>
<pre><code>opt=optimset('Algorithm','active-set','Display','off');
[setpwm,fval,flag]=quadprog(H,F,A,B,[],[],LB,UB,[],opt);
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;H represents the quadratic in the expression 1/2*x'<em>H</em>x + f'*x. If H is not symmetric, quadprog issues a warning and uses the symmetrized version (H + H')/2 instead.&quot; - quadprog MatLab page</p>
<p>&quot;F represents the linear term in the expression 1/2*x'<em>H</em>x + F'*x.&quot; - quadprog MatLab page</p>
<p>&quot;A is an M-by-N matrix, where M is the number of inequalities, and N is the number of variables.&quot; - quadprog MatLab page</p>
<p>&quot;B contains the Linear inequality constraints, specified as a real vector.&quot; - quadprog MatLab page</p>
<p>LB and UB are vectors specifying the upper and lower bounds of the vector x.</p>

<p>I wasn´t able to transfer this syntax to Python. Instead I iterated over the Threshold (p x 1) vector:</p>
<pre><code>def histo(VecIn, ThreshLow, Var1): 
   
    # create upper limits
    ThreshHigh=np.append(ThreshLow[1:],1e5)
    
    # iterate over ThreshLow (i to p)
    histVar1 = []
    for i in range (0, len(LowThresh)):
        # create n x 1 boolean mask
        mask = (v &gt;= LowThresh[i]) &amp; (v &lt; ThreshHigh[i])
        histVar1.append(np.sum(Var1[mask]))

    return np.array(histVar1)
</code></pre>
<p>The upper examples both work for me, but I am looking for a concise (and possibly fast) code alternative. Maybe there are even more efficient ways to write such a function or maybe such a function is part of a common library.</p>

If I have a Gaussian with a mean (mu) and variance (sigma^2), I can write it as,</p>
<pre><code>S(f) = 1/sqrt(2 * pi * sigma^2) .* exp(-(f - mu).^2/(2 * sigma^2))
</code></pre>
<p>Where f is the frequency axis. From Matematica, I found that the analytical expression for IFFT of the square root of the Gaussian pulse as,</p>
<pre><code>s(t) = (2 / pi)^(1/4) .* sqrt(sigma) .* exp(-t .* 2 .* pi .* ((sigma)^2 .* 2 .* pi .* t + 1j .* mu)))
</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>2 * pi * t</code> instead of <code>t</code> from Mathematica because they use angular terms. I don't use this expression in MATLAB anyway. I use IFFT to compare with this expression.</p>
<p>If we closely examine this time-domain <code>s(t)</code>, we notice that the phase is linear. I define the frequency axis the following way,</p>
<pre><code>f = linspace(-1/(2 * PRT), 1/(2 * PRT), N);
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, after doing an IFFT, if I divide <code>2 * pi * mu</code> from the phase of the signal, I should see a linearly varying thing from <code>0</code> to <code>(N - 1)*PRT</code>.</p>
<p>I have <code>N = 60000</code> and <code>PRT = 1e-3</code> so, I should see a plot from <code>0</code> till <code>60</code> seconds linearly. However, I see a nonlinear plot that ends before <code>60</code> seconds.</p>
<p>If I do the same exercise with a Dirac delta instead of a Gaussian spectrum, I see the linear phase correctly.</p>

The size of the signal that is ultimately output in Stateflow is a 6 x 5 array. However, when I send it to the base workspace using the To Workspace Simulink block, I get a much larger array once the simulation is complete. Specifically, when I send it to a 2D array, it was instead a 91056 x 5 2D array mostly full of zeros.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I changed it to output 2D arrays as 3D arrays, and it was a 6 x 5 x 15176 array, and only the last 2D array had non-zero columns.</p>
<p>This indicates that I had made an oversight in my Stateflow chart, and the array is output at every step. I would rather preserve the very last 2D array since I will need only that for later calculations during the simulation (<em>although I am only interested in this first half</em>).</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to preserve only the last array using Simulink blocks once the first half of the simulation is over to use that during the second half, or will I need to develop a clever Matlab user-defined function block?</p>
<p>I've tried creating a function that I thought would work, but I'm not having any luck reducing the size. In fact, <code>x_in</code> and <code>x_out</code> are the same size at the end of the simulation.</p>
<pre><code>function x_out = fcn(x_in)

K = size(x_in,3);
x_out = zeros(6,5);
for k=1:K
    if all(x_in(:,1,k)==0) ||...

        x_out = x_in(:,:,k);
    else
        x_out = x_in(:,:,k);

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Addendum</strong>
I just tried to use a simpler Matlab function block that runs</p>
<pre><code>x_out = x_in(x_in~=0);

<p>and then I put the signal through a reshape block. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvo67.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvo67.png"" alt=""reshape block"" /></a></p>

<li><p>I would like that someone confirm this result from a matricial point of view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initially, I thought that, once I have deleted the 4th row/column of final projected 32x32 matrix, I should make decrease all the superior indices for variables names of matrix from 1,for example starting from the 4th element of 32x32 final matrix ? that is to say, <strong>sp_10_8 should become sp_9_7</strong>, <strong>sp_15_6 should become sp_14_5</strong> etc .... But actually, I am not sure if this is the right method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To perform this changing of variable names (if this is correct), I thought to use regexp in matlab, for example like this :</p>
<pre><code>a=regexprep(array_a,'a_(\d*)_(\d*)','a_${$1-1}_${$2-1}')
</code></pre>
<p>But I get the error message :</p>
<pre><code>Error using regexprep

<p>So finally, Could someone tell me if <strong>the first method (point 1)</strong> is correct from a producial matrix point of view and justified <strong>OR</strong> if this is <strong>the second method that I have to apply (point 2)</strong></p>
<p>Any clarification is welcome.</p>
<h2>Update 1:</h2>
<p>It seems things are a little bit complicated. I think my <code>Jacobian 17x17</code> should be defined of the form :</p>
<pre><code>% Jacobian 17 : 
J_17 = sym('j_', [31,31]);
J_17(:,17:31) = 0;
J_17(17:31,:) = 0;

<p>since I have not a derivative in the first 18 elements for each row, so the number of partial derivatives non-zeros is 17 and not 18.</p>
<p>The following zeros is then increased of 1 more element.</p>
<p>What do you thin about this ?</p>
<p>Finally, in this case, the 2 projected matrices are no more equal.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>1- Why conv() doesn't work for the positive domain and only when the negative numbers are included we get the right result?</p>
<p>2- Is there a way to use only the function conv() and the interval 0 to 10 and get the same result? I want to use convolution integrals in a very complicated code and the direct method is very slow so I want to use conv(). However the structure of the code is such that I can't use the negative domain as I have used in this example.</p>

<p>Here is how my code looks like so far:</p>

<pre><code> t_f = 100; % simulation end time
 h = 0.1;   % sample time
 K = 1;     % controller gain

<p>I'm struggling to write the RK4 function to solve the equations from 'f', also making sure the controller is used.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Following this <a href=""http://www.math.mcgill.ca/gantumur/math579w10/matlab/rk4.m"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>, I've now written a separate function that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function [x v] = RK4(f,a,t_f,x,N)
a = 0;
t_f = 100;
h = 0.1;
N = round(t_f/h);
% h = (t_f - a) / N;
halfh = h / 2;
x(1,:) = x;
v(1) = a;
h6 = h/6;

for i = 1 : N
    v(i+1) = v(i) + h;
    vh2 = v(i) + halfh;
    s1 = f(v(i), x(i,:));
    s2 = f(vh2, x(i,:) + halfh * s1);
    s3 = f(vh2, x(i,:) + halfh * s2);
    s4 = f(v(i+1), x(i,:) + h * s3);
    x(i+1,:) = x(i,:) + (s1 + s2+s2 + s3+s3 + s4) * h6;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>When running the main script this returns the error at line starting with ""s1 = ..."" in the for loop:</p>

<pre><code>Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals.
</code></pre>

<p>Plus, I'm not sure if the controller input needs to be incorporated in this function.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is straightforward, but I'm struggling to get my head around it.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

kk = [4, 4, 5, 7, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4, 9, 7, -2]

<p>So, here I'm having a few problems. When I made a code into python, since there is no way to compute for infinite terms, I'm using <code>while</code> loop but since I don't have a stopping criteria for my problem, the code kept running indefinitely and I had to discard it.</p>
<p>When I use matlab, I used <code>symsum</code> and <code>syms</code> to solve for infinite terms but again I'm getting a solution in terms of a function and not getting a numerical value. Even if I am using a large value for the end term in summation, I am getting a huge function rather than a numerical value.</p>
<p>Apart from that when I use <code>symsum</code>, I am not able to define the different values for Epsilon for different values of <code>n</code>. In the end, I have to find the complete temperature profile of finite cylinder by putting multiple spatial positions (<code>r</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>theta</code> and their counterparts) but due to the above issues, I am not getting a numerical result.</p>

<p>Lastly, What I found for a similar working code was that for my <code>Temp</code> variable, it is reaching extremely high values of the order 10^(+-100) or even 10^(+-300). I know that this is due to the erratic nature of modified bessels functions and their order for different values, but I am not able to restrict those values to a practical range of 1000 to 2000 Kelvin. Is it possible to get the code to work for my case and to restrict the temperature values to a pragmatic range?</p>

<li>Y_m contain the y-coordinates of every point in trajectory.</li>

<p>The above simple method works as long as the trajectory's graph is a proper function (for every x there is only one y).</p>
<p>The trajectory i'm working on is like that:</p>

<p>The sign seems to change within a turn.</p>
<p>I've tried to correct the sign using the sin of the angle between the tangent vector and the trajectory, the sign of the tangent of the angle and other similar stuff, but still i'm looking at some anomalies:

<p>I'm pretty sure that those anomalies came from the fact that the graph is not a proper function and that the solution lies on the angle of the tangent vector, but still something is missing.</p>
<p>Any advice will be really appreciated,

While the game is playing, we make a screen capture of the gameplay. One of the data we capture is when they push a button to request information during the game.</p>
<p>We are trying to understand if there are conditions related to lighting, decision points, etc. that are causing the button to be pushed. Ultimately the goal is to build a predictive model that will present the data before the subject asks for it.</p>
<p>My question is what is the best approach to analyze the video vs. the button push for information? We have timestamped csv files with the button push data and a video of the gameplay. Originally I thought of using Matlab to do the analysis, but I couldn't find a good example of how to approach the problem. I have a couple folks skilled at python on the team that I could ask for help as well, but I had wanted to see if I could understand what needed to be done before tasking them to do it.</p>

However, when we perform convolution with Gaussian filtering, another parameter: the window size of Gaussian filter should also be determined at the same time. For example, when we use <code>fspecial</code> function provided by MATLAB, not only the standard derivation but also the window size must be provided. Intuitively, the larger the Gaussian standard derivation is the bigger the Gaussian kernel window should. However, there is no general rule about how to set the right window size. Any ideas?

<p>I think that I have to get &quot;known methods&quot; to inverse a matrix, in order to avoid to apply a raw inversion with <strong>INV</strong> Matlab's function.</p>
<p>Maybe this technique could be exploited by GPU. If not this is no bad, the most important is to find an algorithm of inversion of symbolic matrix that allows to gain in runtime.</p>
<p>What are the existing algorithms of inversion that I could potentially use?</p>
<h2>Update 1</h2>
<p>Here is what I am doing in this script.</p>
<p>First, the system of equations is just an equality with 2 matrices 12x12. The first one is obtained quickly by removing columns/rows to get a first 12x12 matrix.</p>
<p>The second matrix is more difficult to get : I have to inverse a 31x31 matrix, then on the inverse matrix, I marginalize by removing all nuisance Moterms, that is to say, by removing columns/rows to get a 12x12 matrix and I reinverse this latter to finally have the second matrix equal to the first one described above.</p>
<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p>I realized that it might possible to reduce the runtime, thanks to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schur complement</a> : Indeed, we could write :</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnw7s.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnw7s.png"" alt=""Method od Schur"" /></a></p>
<p>I did the following modifications :</p>
<pre><code>% Using Schur complement formula
D = FISH_SYM(13:31,13:31)
inv_D = inv(D)
% Apply formula of Schur complement
COV_ALL = FISH_SYM(1:12,1:12) - FISH_SYM(1:12,13:31)*inv_D*FISH_SYM(13:31,1:12)
FISH_ALL2 = inv(COV_ALL);
</code></pre>
<p>instead of &quot;big&quot; inversion with first inversion on 31x31 matrix:</p>
<pre><code>COV_ALL = inv(FISH_SYM);
% Marginalize
COV_ALL([13:31],:) = [];
COV_ALL(:,[13:31]) = [];
FISH_ALL2 = inv(COV_ALL);
</code></pre>
<p>Do you think my modifications are right ?</p>

Occasionally the simulations require more resource that is allocated to them by the job scheduler (I believe PBS uses CGroups to enforce system resource constraints) this results in the OOM killer terminating one of the processes in the container. I have illustrated the simplified process structure below:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dT2ap.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dT2ap.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>The process that gets killed seems to be non-deterministic, in some instances, the <em>Numerical Solver</em> is killed by OOM Killer, other instances it is the main simulation process. The problem is that the singularity container does not exit in all of these cases, only when the main Simulation is killed (not when the Numerical Solver or the Matlab_Helper process are killed).</p>
<p>Can I monitor the <em>SIGCHILD</em> signals sent to the Singularity runtime process and check the child process exit code? Can I check for <em>SIGKILL</em> for any of the processes in the process group? Is there a simpler approach to terminating the container when the job exceeds its resource limit?</p>

Again in (<a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-kepler-texture-objects-improve-performance-and-flexibility/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a>), you can see that at the end of the code, the athor uses:</p>

<p>If i use this at the end of my MEX gateway code, the compiled mex function works only for 70 times  in the Matlab for loop and then there is no output (just zeros). Once i try to reset the GPU in Matlab to free all the memories, i get this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>This error does not come up on versions other than 2019a and only when running the training process from a linux executable.

<p>So, what I have initially is this ASD and PSD of the signal:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVnf2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVnf2.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>What I want at the end: is a <strong>signal in time-series domain.</strong></p>
<p>I've read a lot of forum pages and I knew that <em><strong>ifft</strong></em> here should take place in order to switch from the frequency domain to the time-domain (for ex. a good algorithm was presented here: <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-do-I-generate-time-series-data-from-given-PSD-of-random-vibration-input"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-do-I-generate-time-series-data-from-given-PSD-of-random-vibration-input</a>)</p>
<p>The thing is that I also already have a signal in the time domain (acquired from additional software), so I can check myself whether my ifft works correct or not.</p>
<p>To sum up, if everything works correctly, the ASD and PSD of the output time-series signal should coincide with the input ASD and PSD:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/et80w.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/et80w.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>My problem is that I can not calculate correctly the amplitude spectrum in the frequency domain U(f) in order to use it further in the ifft procedure:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tP8eI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tP8eI.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Here on the graphs below the cyan curve is the U(f) as it <strong>should</strong> be and the grey curve as I have it. And hence the output ASD and PSD do not coincide with the input ones (right graph below)
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yt417.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yt417.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p><em>Could you tell me please which kind of transformation shall I use in order to get from the input ASD (or PSD) to the correct U(f)?</em></p>
<p>Here is the equation for the initial function:</p>
<pre><code>y = (1e-12 * sqrt( (1e-3./f).^4 ./  ((1e-5./f).^4+1) + 1 + (f/1e-1).^4)).^2;

acc_freq_asd = abs(sqrt(y)); %convert to ASD
acc_freq_psd = abs(y); %convert to PSD
</code></pre>
<p>The plotted U(f) 'grey curve' was acquired by the following formula:</p>
<pre><code>U_f = sqrt(2*acc_freq_psd.*tslength);
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>tslength</code> - is the signal length</p>
<p>But I've also used many more combinations (with the normalizations and etc) but none of them give the correct U(f).</p>
<p>Will be really appreciate for your help!</p>

<p>I'm sending some data from an esp8266 via Wifi to Matlab. Esp8266 is the Server and in Matlab
I am using the tcpipclient function. Everything working fine i can send and receive data.</p>
<p>But the problem is everytime i call the function tcpipclient Matlab opens a new port for communication. I cant receive data faster than 30-50ms. But i have a sampletime for data of 10ms.</p>
<p>I did write a C++ tcpclient to test the ESP8266 there i can send data every 5ms.</p>
<p>Do anybody know how to archive this sampling time in Matlab with the tcpipclient or does any workarounds ?</p>
<p>The old function where you can open and close the tcpip function manually are not longer supported in Matlab.</p>

The problem I have is detailed below:</p>
<p>I have tried to write a sliding window function that will search through row <code>r</code> of my 2-D matrix and look for non-zero digits.<br />
For each non-zero digit, the function should look for the presence of a non-zero element within the <code>2x2</code> neighbourhood (2 numbers either side of the non-zero element) of row <code>r</code> and of row <code>r+1</code> (and <code>r-1</code> if it exists).<br />
If the neighbourhood is empty, that original element in row <code>r</code> should be zeroed, otherwise all non-zero elements within the window should be kept.<br />
To complicate things, I am also trying to make the sliding window circular, so that when it reaches the end of the row, it doesn't get compressed, but rather includes numbers from the start of the row in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>For all rows, I can also only keep a &quot;connected&quot; element, if it is in some way connected to row 1, so continuous lines down my matrix cannot start in row 2.</p>
<p>I've written this with <code>for</code>-loops in Matlab, and ran into problems when trying to manipulate values within the window. Aside from that, my function is really slow. Is there a way to do this in Matlab or Python without using <code>for</code>-loops, and without any pre-installed toolboxes?</p>
<p>Sample Matlab Code: &quot;test&quot; is a binary matrix (but not all matrices I'll look at will be binary). It contains 5 rows. This is dummy code I wrote for row 1. The window manipulation (line 4 of the code) doesn't work, but hopefully this will give you some idea of what I'm trying to do. This code also omits the edges of the matrix as I wasn't sure the best way to make this circular.</p>
<pre><code>n=2 % size of neighborhood to look at
p=size(test,2) % length of row

for ii=1+n:p-n;
    if test(1,ii)==1;
        if sum(test(2,(ii-2:ii+2))+test(1,(ii-2:ii+2)))&gt;=2;
           test(2,(ii-2:ii+2))=test(2,(ii-2:ii+2))*2;
        else;
           test(1,ii)=0;
        end;
    end;
end

<p>That works, however the calculation times are relative long, one step takes between 9 and 13 seconds, although the matlab calculation need only about 1.5 -2 seconds. Therefore the training time is very high which is very annoying.
Unfortunately you can't rewrite the environment to Python, would be too much work and compiling to c++ would also be rather difficult.</p>
<p>Is there nevertheless a better way?
Does anyone have an idea how to improve that?
Is there any interface between python and matlab which could help here?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Best
Chris</p>

As part of a much larger code I'm reading in data from a netCDF input file. I produce this input file beforehand. The code has been written to expect a term F which is an array shaped like t-by-x-by-y-by-z where time t usually has around 20 values, and x and y dimensions are usually of the order 1000 entries each and z has usually about 5.</p>
<p>In summary, F is a 20x1000x1000x5 array.</p>
<p>This format is incredibly slow to read. It is many times faster to read it if it's written in the format x-by-y-by-z-by-t.</p>
<p>So what instead I am now producing an input netCDF file containing Fnew, which is a 1000x1000x5x20 array.</p>
<p>Now my question: I want to make as few changes to the larger code as possible, so after Fnew is read in, I immediately want to rearrange it to match F.</p>

<p>Edit:
Homework would be fun...background:
I try to implement a simple image resize algorithm. Finally I want use the codegenerator to create the corresponding C code. This is the current implementation:</p>
<pre><code>function [ J ] = resize( I, sc ) %#codegen

% Function implements an algorithm to scale down given image 'I' by factor 'sc':
%
% Input data description:
% I : Grayscale 2-dimensional image
% sc: Image scale factor [-]

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
assert( isa( I , 'uint8' ) );
assert( isa( sc, 'uint8' ) );
assert( ( sc &gt;= 0 ) &amp;&amp; ( sc &lt;= 10 ) );

% Calculate scaled image size [pixel]:
ns = uint8( fix( size( I ) / single( sc ) ) );
nr = ns( 1 );
nc = ns( 2 );

% Number of elements within window:
nw = sc * sc;

% Resulting image:
J = zeros( ns, 'uint8' );

% Create index lookup table to access windows within 'I':
ri = reshape( 1 : sc * nr, sc, nr );
ci = reshape( 1 : sc * nc, sc, nc );

% Loop over image 'I' and calculate mean for each window 'w' of size [sc sc]:
% coder.unroll( );
for c = 1 : nc
%   coder.unroll( );
    for r = 1 : nr
        % Extract window 'I_w' of fixed size [sc sc] from image 'I': 
        I_w = I( ri( :, r ), ci( :, c ) );
            
        % Calculate mean of window 'I_w':
        s = uint16( 0 );
%       coder.unroll( );
        for i = 1 : nw
            s = s + uint16( I_w( i ) );
        end
        J( r, c ) = s / uint16( nw );                
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This works well. With I=[120 160], sc=6 I get:</p>
<pre><code>  /* MATLAB Function: '&lt;S4&gt;/Resize' */
  for (loop_ub = 0; loop_ub &lt; 26; loop_ub++) {
    for (r = 0; r &lt; 20; r++) {
      s = 0U;
      for (nz = 0; nz &lt; 36; nz++) {
        s = (uint16_T)((uint32_T)rtu_I[((ci[loop_ub * 6 + nz / 6] - 1) * 120 +
          ri[r * 6 + nz % 6]) - 1] + s);
      }

      z = (uint16_T)(s / 36U);
      s = (uint16_T)((uint32_T)s - (uint16_T)(z * 36U));
      if ((s &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (s &gt;= 18)) {
        z++;
      }

      rtb_I_sc[r + 20 * loop_ub] = (uint8_T)z;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Variables ci, ri are pre- computed by the codegenerator and const arrays within the C code. Nice. Calculating the image index has still a lot overhead:</p>
<pre><code> s = (uint16_T)((uint32_T)rtu_I[((ci[loop_ub * 6 + nz / 6] - 1) * 120 + ri[r * 6 + nz % 6]) - 1] + s);
</code></pre>
<p>Now my idea was to pre- compute all required indicies:</p>
<pre><code>% Create index lookup table to access windows within 'I':
% ri = repelem( reshape( 1 : sc * nr, sc, [] ), sc, 1 );
% ri = repmat( ri, 1, nr );
% 
% ci = repelem( reshape( 1 : sc * nc, sc, [] ), 1, nc );
% ci = repmat( ci, sc, 1 );
% 
% id = sub2ind( size( I ), ri(:), ci(:) );
% 
% id = reshape( id, N, [] );
% 
% % Loop over image 'I' and calculate mean for each window 'w' of size [sc sc]:
% for c = 1 : nc
%     for r = 1 : nr
%         % Extract window 'I_w' of fixed size [sc sc] from image 'I': 
%         I_w = I( id( :, r * c ) );
%             
%         % Calculate mean of window 'I_w':
%         s = uint16( 0 );
%         for i = 1 : N
%             s = s + uint16( I_w( i ) );
%         end
%         J( r, c ) = s / uint16( N );                
%     end
% end
</code></pre>
<p>Above code is not working properly at all, but the main issue is that the indicies are not pre-computed. The implementation seems to be too complicate for the code generator. Therefore I was looking for some magic reshape (whatever) commands to setup the lookup tables.</p>

<p><strong>Code Generation with Custom messages</strong>
Custom message and service types can be used with ROS Simulink blocks for generating C++ code for a standalone ROS node. The generated code (.tgz archive) will include Simulink definitions for the custom messages, but it will not include the ROS custom message packages. When the generated code is built in the destination Linux System, it expects the custom message packages to be available in the catkin workspace or on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Ensure that you either install or copy the custom message package to your Linux system before building the generated code.</p>

<p>I did the maths and 550*539=296450 and  296450 * 527=156229150: If we divide the last number by the number of elements it equals 2 and thus is divisible into the total number of elements. In my opinion the reshape function is not able to find the size of the last dimension or defines it as 1.
Defining the size of z also results in an error suggesting using the brackets [], so the function can find it.</p>

Number of elements must not change. Use [] as one of the size inputs to automatically calculate the appropriate size

<p>I can write standalone C Code and launch it with GDB, however a child process will crash the software as only 1 thread is allowed to open a connection to camera at a time. If I don't set break points within the code interacting with device all is fine. But I want to stop the program say after acquiring image buffer, but before copying the data into MATLAB output, the child process spawned by the debugger causes everything to lock up.</p>
<p>Anyone know how I might address this?</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;Unreliable&quot; is not a good wording. Basically, I retrieve an image buffer from camera (which is dynamically allocated because image bitdepth is variable). This array is created/destroyed with mxMalloc and mxDestroyArray which works okay if I have <code>MATLAB_MEM_MGR</code> enabled. This is part of what I would like to debug inside MEX.

The error I get in GDB is actually a GenICam error for <code>RESOURCE_IN_USE</code>. My intuition is because the parent process hasn't released the camera resources, the child thread started actually causes issues if that makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
As suggested by users @jack and @veryreverie in the comments below, it's better to sort directly <code>femi</code>, <code>femj</code> and <code>femk</code>. I guess that ranking/sorting <code>femi</code> first (and sorting <code>femj</code> and <code>femk</code> according to <code>femi</code>) and then ranking/sorting <code>femj</code> (and sorting <code>femi</code> and <code>femk</code> according to <code>femj</code>) provides the desired result. The only thing left is to deal with duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2 :</strong><br>
I translated line by line the serialized version of the C code by <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1066.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Engblom and Lukarksi </a>. This document explains very clearly their reasoning and I think it's useful for beginners like me. However, due to my inexperience, I was unable to translate the parallelized version of the code. Maybe that prompts another question.</p>

<p>I call another function, </p>

<pre><code>SamplingRate_Callback(handles.SamplingRate, eventdata, handles)

<p>SamplingRate_Callback sets a few variables, </p>

<pre><code>handles.a = 1;
handles.b = 2;
handles.c = 3;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>handles</code> structure updates correctly within the <code>SamplingRate_Callback</code> function. The problem I am having is that unless I change the function to </p>

<pre><code>function handles = SamplingRate_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles),

<p>I cannot return the data to the calling function, <code>MyGUI_OpeningFcn</code>. I have tried using <code>guidata(gcf, handles)</code> and <code>guidata(hObject, handles)</code>, but neither works. </p>

<p>Would you be able to shed some light on this problem?</p>

<p>Also, I am not sure when to use <code>guidata(gcf, handles)</code> vs. <code>guidata(hObject, handles)</code>. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT (<em>progress</em>)</strong></p>
<p>I've made progress using constrained B-splines with the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cobs/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cobs</a> package.  Using <code>pointwise</code>, I can implement the first constraint, <code>f(0)=0</code>, exactly as desired and can implement <code>d f(x) / d x = 0</code> at an arbitrary value of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>However, I do need to specify that value of <code>x</code> where <code>d f(x) / d x = 0</code>.  Below, I do so by specifying that it occurs at a value of <code>x = bmax * max(x)</code> (though in playing around with the degree to which the simulated data saturate, it's clear that it's still possible for <code>d f(x) / d x = 0</code> to begin at values of <code>x</code> less than <code>bmax * max(x)</code> as well).</p>
<pre><code>y &lt;- y1
spfit &lt;- cobs::cobs(x, y,
          constraint = 'increase',
          pointwise = rbind(
             c(0, 0, 0),            # force through origin
             c(2, bmax * max(x), 0) # force df/dx = 0 at bmax*max(x)
           ) )
</code></pre>
<p>With this approach I no longer need to estimate <code>b</code> directly (i.e. I can instead use <code>predict()</code> and evaluate <code>spfit</code> at <code>bmax * max(x)</code>).</p>
<p>The question now is: <em>How can I make <code>bmax</code> a free parameter?</em></p>

<p>Which just says what files were found and in which folder.</p>
<p>The actual search function at the top takes 8-30 seconds on my drives and is working. Now I thought I could maybe speed this up a little more with afterEach. The basic idea being, that the if the contents of the folders that are being processed in the parfor loop are very different in quantity, theres a single folder holding back the process, because it needs to finish before the function can resume its work after the parfor loop.</p>
<p>For that I have created the following script:</p>
<pre><code>clc;
clear all;

path = 'D:\';

        parfor n = 1:height(input)

<p>The two functions &quot;searchforae&quot; and &quot;searchparforae&quot; are exactly the same, except for the loop. As it might be obvious from the names &quot;searchforae&quot; has a for loop, while &quot;searchparforae&quot; has a parfor loop.</p>

<p>The searchparforae function in contrast is working just as well as the searchfordata function at the top. But instead of 8-30 seconds its taking 5-10 minutes. Am I using afterEach wrong? Why is it taking that long? Also why isnt the searchforae function working correctly even tho the only difference is a for loop instead of a parfor compared to searchparforae?</p>

My job is related to tomography imaging using synchrotron radiation. This is a new field for me and I start to face with Matlab to write some code.</p>

<p>I am completely new with tomography imaging and Matlab shows new challenges for me.
My actual problem is to create sinograms from a stacking of parallel image projections.
For whose are not in the field, a sinogram is a map detecting the projection on the detector of the position of a feature in the sample, as function of angle between the X-Ray beam and the sample.</p>

<p>What I get from an experiment is a series of 2D radiography at different angles, you can see it as a rectangular ""volume"" where dimensions are the number of rows and columns in the single projection, respectively, and volume is given from the number of angles. A sinogram is just a transversal cut of this volume. This means reading the volume not from lateral side but from the top, so I will create a new array of images, whose dimensions are the number of columns and projection, and array lenght the number of rows in the projections.
To give numbers in this experiment I have 4000 projections with size 2048x1370 pixels, so for my computer skills this is a huge computational problem.</p>

<p>I need your help to perform some operations faster. 
My code in a first part allocates an array to contain all images, this is a 34 Gb array but I have 130 Gb RAM, so no problem. The code to perform this operation uses a loop of imread:</p>

<pre><code>for i=2:num_proj
    filename=strcat(path_im,list_proj(i).name);
    image=imread(filename);
    imArray(:,:,i)=image;
end 
</code></pre>

<p>This is not the fastest way off course, now it takes 332 seconds to create this array. I have found several solutions to improve this and I will do it.</p>

<p>Second step is to divide for a flat field (image taken without the sample).
My code takes the flat and using imdivide divides each image in the array for the flat image:</p>

<pre><code>for i=1:size(imArray, 3);
    imArray(:,:,i)=imdivide(imArray(:,:,i), flat);
end
</code></pre>

<p>this step seems to be fast however it is called 4000 times. Do you have suggestion? Is there a better way to perform it?</p>

<p>Now my greatest problem is how to take in the fastest way the horizontal cut in the projection volume?
My basic idea to read the volume from the ""top"". is reported below, it does its job, however it takes long time:</p>

<pre><code>for i=1:size(sinogram, 3)
        for k=1:size(sinogram, 1)
            sinogram(k,:,i)=imArray(i,:,k);

        end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Can you help me to speed up also this operation?
I hope my question is clear, otherwise please ask and I will try to explain it better.</p>

In the example below, 'formula' contains a string with the function and arguments to be evaluated (e.g., &quot;sum( var1, var2 )&quot; ).  The formulas sometimes contain function calls nested within function calls, so the code below would be used recursively until obtaining the final result:</p>
<pre><code>Func2 = str2func( sprintf( '@(%s) %s', strjoin( varNames, ',' ), formula ) );
</code></pre>
<p>This evaluates fine for native MATLAB functions.  But there's a particular case of a function (named Func1) I made myself that not only needs the list of variables but also an object as argument, like this:</p>
<pre><code>function output = Func1( anObject, varNames )
    % do some stuff with the object and the vars
end
</code></pre>
<p>For this particular function, I've tried doing this:</p>
<pre><code>  Func2 = str2func( sprintf( '@(%s,%s) %s',  &quot;objectToPassToFunc1&quot;, strjoin( varNames, ',' ), &quot;Func1(objectToPass,&quot;&quot;&quot; + strjoin( varNames, '&quot;,&quot;' ) +&quot;&quot;&quot;)&quot; ) )
</code></pre>
<p>...which doesn't throw an error, but Func1 doesn't receive the objectToPassToFunc1, instead it gets values from one of the variables in varNames.   And I don't know why.</p>
<p>So how can I correctly pass the object to Func1????</p>

<p>The simplest motion capture file is just a massive table with 'XYZ' coordinates for each point attached to a recorded subject, and for every frame captured. I know that I can find individual methods and functions in R to perform complex operations (like principal component analysis) or I can plot time series for all the points. But when I am looking for examples that could also educate me statistically about analysing human movement, and provide with nice toolbox for visual representation of data, R turns out to be a cold desert. On the other hand, MATLAB has <a href=""http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~neill/mocap/"">Motion capture toolbox</a> and <a href=""https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mocaptoolbox"">MoCap Toolbox</a> and especially the latter has quite good options for plotting and analysing the captures. But let's be honest - MATLAB has quite ugly visualisation engine comparing to R.</p>

<p>Some specific requests for R motion capture package would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>reading, editing, visualizing and transforming mocap data</li>
<li>kinetic and kinematic analysis</li>
<li>time-series and principal component analysis</li>
<li>animating data</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I missing something here (in my Googling) or is there really no mocap packages out there for R? Have anyone tried playing with motion capture data in R? Can you give me some directions?</p>

However, I can not generate an array of class in Simulink. I realize that I should instantiate an array in Simulink but how can I instantiate a class?</p>
<pre><code>arrivedArray(3, 65536) = queueInfo;

<p>In the picture above, queueInfo is my class. This two lines return with the following error.
Code generation requires variable arrivedArray to be fully defined before subscribing it.
By the way, this is the suggested method by Matlab for creating an array of class but somehow it doesn't work. Later I've tried this one:</p>
<pre><code>        persistent arrivedArray
if isempty(arrivedArray)
    arrivedArray(3, 655336) = queueInfo;
end
persistent analysisArray
if isempty(analysisArray)
    analysisArray(3, 65536) = queueInfo;
end
</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn't work either. The error İs:
Persistent variable 'arrivedArray' must be assigned before it is used. The only exception is a check using 'isempty(arrivedArray)' that can be performed prior to assignment.
I understand the error but have no idea how to fix it. A constructor did not help me too. Here is my class structure:

<pre><code>classdef transactionInfo

I'm using the Colebrook-White &amp; Darcy-Weisbach equation to solve for hf within a for loop and want the results inputted into an array.</p>
<p>This is what I've done so far:</p>
<pre><code>%% Constants due to Rising main system

Q = 0.08;       % m^3/s

%% Calculating hf for the system curve (DW)
Q_sys = [0:10:120];
hf_sys = zeros(1, length(Q_sys));
for i = 1:length(hf_sys)
    syms hf
    DW = Q_sys(i)==2*sqrt(2*9.81*D*hf/L)*log(ks/3.7/D+2.51*nu/D/sqrt(2*9.81*D*hf/L))*(pi*D^2/4);
    hf_sys(i) = vpasolve(DW, hf);
end
hf_sys % to display hf_sys

<p>My problem is that after execution, the following message is displayed:</p>
<pre><code>Unable to perform assignment because the left and right sides have a different number of elements.

Error in calcs (line 63)
    hf_sys(i) = vpasolve(DW, hf);
</code></pre>
<p>This is due to the return value of <code>vpasolve(DW, hf)</code> after the second iteration being <code>Empty sym: 0-by-1</code>. Which is what I'm trying to resolve.</p>

I need to do Collision detection and therefore I wanna use the GJK algorithm. In MATLAB it is possible to compile a so-called MEX function. With the MEX function it is possible to call your own C or C++ programs from the MATLAB command line as if they were built-in functions.
My problem is that the Bullet library is very big with a lot of files, header function and so on and I am not really familiar with programming. I looked for simpler implementations and found:</p>

My first approach was saving the image using fwrite(), but MatLab seems to always be defaulting to Windows-1252 encoding, which looses some of the data when writing. (If I open the original input and the output, the content is identical, except for the output missing characters like &quot;ÿØÿà&quot;, which obviously means the image is getting corrupted.</p>
<p>I did not find a way to work around this encoding problem.</p>
<p>While I do think this apporach should be working, I also don't really want to write the data to a file before opening it. Just immediately creating an image variable would be preferable. I did not find a solution for doing it this way, though.</p>

It works fine, but whenever I try to run the code, the operations are done without respecting pauses each time. This part gets paused in the right way, as it should be:</p>

I've tried all the basic ones like hot,parula,autumn,jet,hsv, and also tried them with exponents (the picture from my software is with jet.^0.35, so it's jet but every RGB coefficient is to the power of 0.35)</p>

I want this screenshot to be PDF (vector graphic, -> pdflatex) with a tight bounding box, by that I mean no unneccessary white space around the diagram.</strong></p>

<p>I have searched the net, searched stackexchange, searched the matlab doc. But no success so far. Some notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>For figures, there are solutions to this question. I have a Simulink block diagram, it's different (see below).</li>
<li>I am aware of solutions using additional software like <code>pdfcrop</code>.</li>
<li>PDF seems to be the only driver that really produces vector graphics (R2013b on Win7 here). The EPS and PS output seems to have bitmaps inside. You zoom, you see it.</li>
</ol>

<h1>What I have tried:</h1>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>The default behaviour of <code>print</code></p>

<pre><code>modelName = 'vdp';         % example system
load_system(modelName);    % load in background

% print to file as pdf and as jpeg
print(['-s',modelName],'-dpdf','pdfOutput1')
print(['-s',modelName],'-djpeg','jpegOutput1')
</code></pre>

<p>The JPEG looks good, tight bounding box. The PDF is centered on a page that looks like A4 or usletter. Not what I want.</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>There are several parameters for printing block diagrams. See the Simulink reference page <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/model-parameters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/model-parameters.html</a>. Let's extract some:</p>

<pre><code>modelName = 'vdp';         % example system
load_system(modelName);    % load in background

PaperPositionMode = get_param(modelName,'PaperPositionMode');
PaperUnits        = get_param(modelName,'PaperUnits');
PaperPosition     = get_param(modelName,'PaperPosition');
PaperSize         = get_param(modelName,'PaperSize');
</code></pre>

<p>According to the documentation, <code>PaperPosition</code> contains a four element vector <code>[left, bottom, width, height]</code>. The last two elements specify the bounding box, the first two specify the distance of the lower left corner of the bounding box from the lower left corner of the paper.</p>

<p>Now when I print the PDF output and measure using a ruler, I find the values of both the bounding box and the position of its lower left corner are totally wrong (Yes, I have measured in <code>PaperUnits</code>).  That's a real bummer. I could have calculated the margins to trim off the paper to be used later in <code>\includegraphics[clip=true,trim=...]{pdfpage}</code>.</p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>Of course what I initially wanted is a PDF that is already cropped. There is a solution for figures, it goes like this: You move the bounding box to the lower left corner of the paper and than change the paper size to the size of the bounding box.</p>

<pre><code>oldPaperPosition = get_param(modelName,'PaperPosition');

set_param(modelName,'PaperPositionMode','manual');
set_param(modelName,'PaperPosition',[0 0 oldPaperPosition(3:4)]);
set_param(modelName,'PaperSize',oldPaperPosition(3:4));
</code></pre>

<p>For simulink models, there are two problems with this. <code>PaperSize</code> is a read-only parameter for models. And changing the <code>PaperPosition</code> has no effect at all on the output. </p>

<p>I'm running out of ideas, really.</p>

<p>EDIT ----------------------------------</p>

<p>Allright, to keep you updated: I talked to the Matlab support about this.</p>

<ul>
<li>In R2013b, there are bugs causing wrong behaviour of PaperPositionMode and the bounding box from PaperPostion to be wrong.</li>
<li>There is no known way to extract the scale factor from print.</li>
<li>They suggested to go this way: Simulink --(print)--> SVG --(Inkscape)--> PDF. It works really good this way. The (correct) bounding box is an attribute of the svg node and the scale factor when exporting to SVG is always the same. Furthermore, Inkscape produces an already cropped PDF. So this approach solves all my problems, just you need Inkscape.</li>

<p>The problem comes from trying to install gstreamer0.10.  It doesn't appear to be working in Ubuntu 17.</p>

<p>This one talks about how gstreamer isn't working on Ubuntu 17: <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/294258-hello-i-have-a-problem-with-videoreader-on-matlab-r2016a-with-ubtuntu-lts16-04"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/294258-hello-i-have-a-problem-with-videoreader-on-matlab-r2016a-with-ubtuntu-lts16-04</a></p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to overcome this issue?  Is there a different package that I could install that would fulfill the same requirements?  I have tried installing matlab-support, and that hasn't helped either.  Is there a different issue other than gstreamer0.10?  </p>

<p>As you can see, the few values of those vectors cause these curves to be of a zigzag shape and I would like them to be more smooth. I tried different methods, both in Python and Matlab. For instance, in python I used the numpy methods like:</p>
<pre><code>xp = np.linspace(300,1500,100,endpoint=True)
z1 = np.polyfit(x,  y1, 3)
p1 = np.poly1d(z1)
z2 = np.polyfit(x, y2, 3)
p2 = np.poly1d(z2)
z3 = np.polyfit(x,y3, 3)
p3 = np.poly1d(z3)
z4 = np.polyfit(x, y4, 3)
p4 = np.poly1d(z4)
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cmZ6i.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cmZ6i.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>but in this way, there are minima and maxima points that I'm not sure are present for the value in between the x vector.
Also, I tried the &quot;smooth&quot; function in Matlab with different smoothing values but they also change the value inside the vectors that are no more like the original ones, i.e. they are meaningless for the concept I want to explain.
I would like just to smooth a little bit the zigzag parts of the plot to make the curve more pleasant to the view..can you help me please? Python or Matlab is the same for me, I'm open to everything! :)</p>

The table contains data and our goal is to sort that table.</p>
<p>Assume our data looks like this, where <code>y1</code> and <code>y2</code> are the data in the columns.</p>

<p>You can produce that plot with MATLAB or GNU Octave.</p>
<pre><code>% Simulate the model
[t,y] = ode45(@odefunc,[0 20],[1; -2]);

% Plot the simulation
close all

function dydt = odefunc(t,y)
  dydt = [y(2); (1-0.1*y(1)^2)*y(2)-y(1) + 1];
end
</code></pre>
<p>If we look above the plot, we are going to se the data like this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2szmN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2szmN.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>You can create that plot with this code:</p>
<pre><code>% Plot 3D bar
figure
imagesc(y)
colorbar
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that the plot have a very much like a &quot;table-look&quot;. <strong>My question</strong> is what algorithm is used when sorting the rows in the table so every row that looks almost the same, have it's own unique position in the table.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a table like this.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 4
1 3 5
2 4 6
3 5 7
4 6 8
5 7 9
0 2 4
1 3 5
2 4 6
3 5 7
4 6 8
5 7 9
0 2 4
1 3 5
2 4 6
3 5 7
4 6 8
5 7 9
0 2 4
1 3 5
</code></pre>
<p>The code if you want to create that table.</p>
<pre><code>j = 0;
rows = 20;
for i = 1:rows
  disp(sprintf(&quot;%i %i %i&quot;, j, j+2, j+4))
  j = j + 1;
  if(j + 4 &gt;= 10)
    j = 0;
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that there are four rows of <code>0 2 4</code> and three rows of <code>5 7 9</code>.
I want all rows <code>0 2 4</code> close to each other and all rows <code>5 7 9</code> close to each other. And.... <code>0 2 4</code> cannot be after <code>5 7 9</code> because then the plot would look terrible.</p>
<p>For example, assume that we begining with <code>row 1</code>, the first row <code>0 2 4</code>. Then we are looking for the same rows of <code>0 2 4</code> and let's say we found four rows <code>0 2 4</code>. Then we sort them.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 4
0 2 4
0 2 4
0 2 4
</code></pre>
<p>Now next row would be <code>1 3 5</code> and we find two rows of <code>1 3 5</code>. We sorting them.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 4
0 2 4
0 2 4
0 2 4
1 3 5
1 3 5
</code></pre>
<p>After we have sorted for a while, we are going to have a table like this.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 4
0 2 4
0 2 4
0 2 4
1 3 5
1 3 5
2 4 6
2 4 6
2 4 6
2 4 6
3 5 7
3 5 7
3 5 7
.
.
.
.
5 7 9
5 7 9
5 7 9
</code></pre>
<p>And now, we found <code>1 2 4</code>, which is very similar to <code>0 2 4</code>. So we need to place <code>1 2 4</code> close to <code>0 2 4</code>, perhaps between <code>0 2 4</code> or <code>1 3 5</code> or after <code>0 2 4</code> or before <code>0 2 4</code>. How do I even know that <code>1 2 4</code> should be placed close to <code>0 2 4</code>? <strong>That's the issue!!!</strong>.</p>
<p>How can I sort that?</p>
<p>I need to do that in C-programming language because speed is most important here, but I think I will start to do it in GNU Octave. I'm pretty sure that there is a SQL-sorting algorithm I'm looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> in practice, there are numbers, integers, 10-bit e.g values between 0-1023.</p>

The structure could contain any number of things, including arrays of different dimensions and lengths. There's a similar question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44739906/work-with-a-matlab-struct-in-c-return-value-of-a-matlab-function-call-libra"">here</a>, but the answer doesn't give enough detail for me to understand and extrapolate.</p>
<p>I'm running MATLAB using the <code>MatlabEngine.hpp</code> and <code>MatlabDataArray.hpp</code>. I need to return a lot of outputs and have tried other methods which don't quite do what I'm after. Using a structure seems the most logical / readable way to do things. I'll try to explain my case with the following examples, which are hopefully written in a way which will be most useful for anyone else with a similar problems.</p>
<h4>MWE 1 - return n by n array</h4>
<h6>MATLAB code</h6>
<pre><code>function output = simple_fun1(a, bc)
% Takes input values of a and an array [a,b]
b = bc(1);
c = bc(2);
sum = a+b+c;
prod = a*b*c;
output = [sum, prod; 3, 4];
</code></pre>
<p>This can be run using the C++ code:</p>
<h6>C++ code</h6>
<pre><code>#include &quot;MatlabEngine.hpp&quot;
#include &quot;MatlabDataArray.hpp&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
  using namespace matlab::engine;
  matlab::data::ArrayFactory factory; // Create MATLAB data array factory

  std::unique_ptr&lt;MATLABEngine&gt; matlabPtr = startMATLAB(); // Start MATLAB engine

  matlabPtr-&gt;eval(u&quot;addpath(genpath('C:/Users/...your path here...'))&quot;); // Add the path to where MATLAB functions are.

  std::vector&lt;double&gt; bc{ 10, 13};
  std::vector&lt;matlab::data::Array&gt; args({
    factory.CreateScalar&lt;double&gt;(7),
    factory.CreateArray({ 1, 2 }, bc.cbegin(), bc.cend())
  });
  
  matlab::data::TypedArray&lt;double&gt; results = matlabPtr-&gt;feval(u&quot;simple_fun1&quot;,args); // Run simple_fun1
  
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sum: &quot; &lt;&lt; results[0][0] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Prod: &quot; &lt;&lt; results[0][1] &lt;&lt; std:endl;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Three: &quot; &lt;&lt; results[1][0] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works for a single return of an n by n array. But if I want to return data separately, i.e. <code>function [sum, prod] = simple_fun1(a,bc)</code> it doesn't work.</p>
<h4>MWE2 - return multiple outputs</h4>
<p>I've managed to return multiple outputs using tuples, but then I can only access the first element of the array (if it was an array output) since I've been unable to define a tuple of MATLAB arrays. For example</p>
<h6>MATLAB code</h6>
<pre><code>function [sum, prod] = simple_fun2(a, bc)
% Takes input values of a and an array [a,b]
b = bc(1);
c = bc(2);
sum = a+b+c;
prod = a*b*c;
</code></pre>
<h6>C++ code</h6>
<pre><code>  std::tuple&lt;double, double&gt; results;
  results = matlabPtr-&gt;feval&lt; std::tuple&lt;double, double&gt;&gt;(u&quot;simple_fun2&quot;, double(7), std::vector&lt;double&gt;{ 10, 13}); // Just as another example of how to enter inputs in case that's helpful for anyone.
  double s;
  double p;
  std::tie(s, p) = results;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sum: &quot; &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; &quot;, Prod: &quot; &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>
<h4>Return structure</h4>
<p>Instead, I would like to write my MATLAB function so that it returns a structure, which should hopefully simplify the code for large amounts of data being passed and allow the data to have different dimensions. However, I've been unable to create a working example.</p>
<h6>MATLAB code</h6>
<pre><code>function output = simple_fun3(a, bc)
b = bc(1);
c = bc(2);
output.sum = a+b+c;
output.prod = a*b*c;
output.a_sq = a*a;
output.b_sq = b*b;
</code></pre>
<h6>C++ code</h6>
<pre><code>#include &quot;MatlabEngine.hpp&quot;
#include &quot;MatlabDataArray.hpp&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

<p>The ""Val."" column corresponds to the <code>k(i)</code> estimates and the ""Std. Err."" column corresponds to <code>kSE(i)</code>. The ""P>|z|"" column gives the p-value for a single coefficient Wald test of the null hypothesis <code>k(i)==0</code> (if this p-value is <code>&lt;0.05</code>, we reject the null hypothesis and thus conclude that the coefficient <code>k(i)</code> may be significant at the 95% level).</p>

<p>Note that to compute the asymptotic covariance matrix of the <code>k(i)</code> estimates, <code>mlecov</code> computes the Hessian <code>H</code> of <code>L(k(1),...,k(10))</code> - which I provide an analytic gradient for. The condition number of <code>H</code> is <code>cond(H)=2.7437e3</code>. The <code>mlecov</code> function does a Cholesky factorization of the Hessian, which gives the upper-triangular matrix <code>R</code> with <code>cond(R)=52.38</code>.</p>

<p><em>Scenario 2</em>. I multiply all samples by <code>0.1</code> and thus run <code>mle</code> and <code>mlecov</code> on the sample data <code>n*0.1</code>, <code>x*0.1</code> and <code>y*0.1</code>. This outputs the following summary:</p>

<p><strong>The p-values have changed</strong>. Also, now <code>cond(H)=9.3831e5</code> (!!!) and <code>cond(R)=968.6616</code>. Note that when I remove the second order terms (<code>x.^2</code> and <code>y.^2</code>) from the mean and standard deviation models, there is no longer this problem (i.e. the p-values stay the same and the <code>k(i)</code> values, except for the constant terms <code>k(1)</code> and <code>k(6)</code>, are simply scaled by 0.1). Does this indicate a numerical issue?</p>

<p><em>Scenario 3</em>. I decided to also try scaling <code>n</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to the interval [-1,1] by dividing their samples by the largest element (i.e. <code>n(i)=n(i)/max(abs(n))</code>, <code>x(i)=x(i)/max(abs(x))</code> and <code>y(i)=y(i)/max(abs(y))</code>). Running <code>mle</code> and <code>mlecov</code> on this scaled sample outputs the following summary:</p>

<p><strong>The p-values have changed again</strong>! Now <code>cond(H)=4.7550e3</code> (higher than Scenario 1 (unscaled) but lower than Scenario 2 (everything multiplied by 0.1)). Also, <code>cond(R)=68.9565</code>, which is only slightly higher than for Scenario 1.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong></p>

<p>The expected behavior across the three analyses, for me, is that <code>k(i)</code> and <code>kSE(i)</code> would change but the p-values would remain the same - in other words, scaling the data should not make any model coefficient more or less statistically significant. This is contrary to the above scenarios, where the p-values change each time!</p>

<p>Please help me to debug this numerical issue - or explain whether this is in fact the expected behavior and I have misunderstood something. Thank you for reading this long post and helping - I tried to encapsulate all relevant problem details here.</p>

Basically, I have images in the following format &quot;B120_B280&quot; Wherein the bolded <strong>B1</strong>20_<strong>B2</strong>80 represent IDs and the bolded B1<strong>20</strong>_B2<strong>80</strong> represent percentages. I need each ID (B1, B2, B3 ..... B34) and each percentage (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) to be paired with the other ID and corresponding percentage.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p><strong>B1100_B20</strong> (100% ID 1 and 0% ID 2)</p>
<p><strong>B180_B220</strong> (80% ID 1 and 20% ID 2)</p>
<p><strong>B160_B240</strong> (60% ID 1 and 40% ID 2)</p>
<p>Until each ID is paired with the other in each combo. I don't need, for example, B20_B1100 because that pair is the equivalent of the first one listed (100% ID 1 and 0% ID 2).</p>
<p>It has been recommended to me to try out for loops, however the formatting keeps failing on me. This is what I've been trying:</p>
<pre><code>ID{1} = {'B', 'B'};
percentages = {'20', '40', '60', '80', '100'};


for version = 1
for np = 1:34 %for each ID
        for morph = 1:6 % for each percentage

            images{version}{np, morph, np, morph} = imread(sprintf(str, ID{version}{np}, percentages{morph}, ID{version}{np}, percentages{morph})); %loads  stimuli
            stim{version}(np, morph, np, morph) = Screen('MakeTexture', window, images{version}{np, morph, np, morph}); %creates textures for stimuli (using psychtoolbox)

The function I'm using is as follows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-matlab prettyprint-override""><code>function printStandardFigure(figInput,filename)
     dpi = 300;

     newFig = copyobj(figInput,groot);

     newFig.Units = 'inches';
     newFig.InnerPosition = [1,1,6.5/2,6.5/2];

     print(filename,'-dpng',['-r',num2str(dpi)]);

     close(newFig);
end
</code></pre>
<p>In theory, this should create a copy of the figure I've made with all its axes, etc. identical to the original but resized to fit the new window size. What actually happens is that the <code>'Position'</code> property for one of the axes gets reset to [0, 0, 1, 1], but the other one displays just fine. This still happens even when I set the <code>ActivePositionProperty</code> to <code>'position'</code>, which normally causes the axis to hold the <code>Position</code> property constant.</p>
<p>I've also tried using <code>copyobj</code> to copy just the two axes over to the new figure, but I have similar issues with resizing, and this doesn't import any legends even though they are set as children of the axes.</p>
<p>This code works just fine if I only have one axis, so why does the second axis cause it to screw up? I've tried making the original figure have the same aspect ratio as the new one, and I've tried setting their sizes to be exactly equal using the <code>InnerPosition</code> property. I can't figure out what's going on and Matlab's documentation isn't helping.</p>

The original figure was created to have the same dimensions as the exported plot, just to make sure that resizing the axes wasn't causing the issue. I also get the same problem when I remove lines 6 and 7 from the export function (where I set the size of the new figure).</p>

This process works in an assembly line manner, where each team of welders will do their weld on a piece of pipe, finish and move forward to the next weld along the pipeline, while the next team of welders takes their place on the first weld to do the next pass along it. BUT each weld phase on a specific piece (in the common case there are 4 phases, Root, Hot, Fill and Cap) is done by a specific group of welders that are assigned to that task, and each phase will take a different amount of time.</p>
<p>An example:
Root Pass Team does the first weld, and moves to second.
Hot Pass team starts first weld after root pass moves on.
Once root pass finished second weld and hot pass finished first, they both move forward.
Fill Pass Team starts the first weld.
etc...</p>
<p>Where it begins to get complicated is that there is only ONE of both the Root Pass and Hot Pass teams, because they set the pace of the line, but they also move quicker than the Fill Pass and Cap Pass teams, so we can have multiple Fill and Cap teams if necessary.</p>
<p>The goal of this program is to simulate a full pipeline process, and then determine how many of both the fill and cap pass teams we would need to keep the process moving slowly without a) the fill and cap pass teams falling behind, or b) without having too many extra teams where we have people spending a long time sitting around doing nothing.</p>
<p>I have gotten somewhere with my code. I can and have modelled this in the scenario where each team can instantaneously move and start at the next weld location, which is fine and dandy, but truthfully there is time between each weld. I have also modelled it with this time between welds but that has created problem and is what I hope to fix. Currently, if a team is moving between locations, they are still showing in the program as being located at the weld they just finished, therefore preventing someone else from starting there. I also have another issue wherein if I have a scenario in which a fill team finishes their job before the Hot Pass Team ahead of them, the Fill Team begins moving and if the Hot Pass Team ahead of them finishes during that time, another Fill Team will be &quot;created&quot; within the program to take up the spot where the hot pass finishes, which is somewhat foolish, as the Fill Team that was moving would have been there to start that weld shortly.</p>
<p>I am not sure how to go about modelling this sort of scenario properly, as I have very little experience, but everything that I have done so far, I have done with matrices and loops in MATLAB. Here is the code that I have so far. Any advice on how to approach the issues in the above paragraph would be very helpful.</p>

I have already tried a lot of functions in order to achieve this: pracma::findpeaks, fluoR::find_peaks, splus2R::peaks, IDPmisc::peaks (this one has one argument regarding peak width, but the result is not the same). I have already looked in other functions as well, including packages for chromatography and spectoscropy analysis in bioconductor.

<p>The findpeaks function in MATLAB is used for finding local maximas and has the following charcateristics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the local maxima. The peaks are output in order of occurrence. The first sample is not included despite being the maximum. For the flat peak, the function returns only the point with lowest index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explanation for the &quot;MinPeakWidth' argument in MATLAB web site is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimum peak width, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'MinPeakWidth' and a positive real scalar. Use this argument to select only those peaks that have widths of at least 'MinPeakWidth'.
If you specify a location vector, x, then 'MinPeakWidth' must be expressed in terms of x. If x is a datetime array, then specify 'MinPeakWidth' as a duration scalar or as a numeric scalar expressed in days.
If you specify a sample rate, Fs, then 'MinPeakWidth' must be expressed in units of time.
If you specify neither x nor Fs, then 'MinPeakWidth' must be expressed in units of samples.</p>

My thinking is to do a k-means clustering (with k=N) on the set of points, and then choose the &quot;best&quot; point from each cluster to be retained in the reduced set.</p>
<p>My problem is that sometimes the points are extremely concentrated in areas, and it doesn't really make sense for me to retain two points that are closer than say 10^-4, so I would like to give it the flexibility to let k &lt; N, if it is the case that the clusters are too close together - or, better still, force any points that are closer together than some threshold to be in a cluster together, thereby potentially breaking up some of the other clusters with points that are further apart from each other, as it tries to maximise the number of clusters.</p>
<p>Is there a parameter setting for k-means in MATLAB, or a completely different function, that will let me do this? At the moment, I am just whittling the points down using the method I described above, and then doing a pairwise distance comparison on all the retained points to find sets of points that are too close, and then keeping the best points from those sets.</p>
<p>It works, but I thought it was worth seeing if there was already a function that does it better than my slightly hacky way.</p>
<p>I know about the &quot;elbow method&quot; for determining the optimal value of k for k-means clustering, but that doesn't really suit my purpose, as I am not interested in the optimal value for k, just the maximum value for k, such that k &lt;= N, where the distance between clusters is greater than some threshold.</p>

471,472,1621595075.0,Stack Overflow,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67635618/julia-outperformed-by-matlab,Julia outperformed by MATLAB?,"<p>I have been trying to optimise some code that takes input signal in the form of a 2D array and convolves it with a gaussian of a certain FWHM. The size of this 2D signal array is (671, 2001), and I am convolving along the second axis - the time axis. Where,</p>
<pre><code>time = 0:0.5:1000
nt = length(time)  # nt = 2001
</code></pre>
<p>I am convolving with a gaussian of FWHM of 150, corrosponding to a standard deviation of about 63.7. I then pad the initial signal by 3 times the FWHM, setting the new values before the original start index as 0 and the new values after the original end index as the signal at the last time point.</p>
<p>Hence, <code>nt = 3801</code> after padding.</p>
<p>My MATLAB code calculates this convolution in 117.5043 seconds. This is done through a nested for loop over each of the axis - should be slow in MATLAB. The main bit of theMATLAB code is as follows,</p>
<pre class=""lang-matlab prettyprint-override""><code>for it = 1:nt
    % scan convolution mask across time
    kernal  = preb*exp(-b*(tc-tc(it)).^2); % convolution mask - Gaussian
    N(it) = sum(kernal)*dt;                % normalise
  
    kernal = kernal/N(it); % ensure convolution integrates to 1

    % calculate convolution for each row
    for iq = 1:Nq
        WWc(iq,it) = dt*sum((WWc0(iq,1:nt).').*kernal(1:nt));
    end
end

</code></pre>
<p>I have rewritten this in Julia, except using circulant matrices to construct a gaussian kernal, this effectivley removes the foor loop over time, and the kernal to be applied over all time is now fully defined by one matrix. I then either loop over the rows and multiply this kernal by the signal of each row, or use the <code>mapslices</code> function. The main bit of code in Julia is as follows,</p>
<pre><code>K = Circulant(G.Fx) # construct circulant matrix of gaussian function G.Fx
conv = zeros(nr, nt) # init convolved signal

#for i=1:nr # If using a loop instead of mapslice
#    conv[i, :] = transpose(sC[i, :]) * K
#end

conv = mapslices(x -&gt; K*x, sC; dims=2)

</code></pre>
<p>In Julia this convolution takes 368 seconds (almost 3 times as slow as MATLAB), despite using circulant matrices to skip a foor loop and reducing it down to multiplying two arrays of size (1, 3801) and (3801, 3801) for each row.</p>
<p>output of @time:</p>
<pre><code>368.047741 seconds (19.37 G allocations: 288.664 GiB, 14.30% gc time, 0.03% compilation time)
</code></pre>
<p>Both are run on the same computer, should Julia not outperform MATLAB here?</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Playing around with the Julia code some more, I have rewritten the matrix multiplication in terms of loops, but it is still slow. The convolution is performed within a function although calls two external constructor types - Gaussian or Lorentzian depending on an input flag. I also load SpecialMatrices.jl for the Circulant constructor. I am new to Julia and not sure if that would make it slow. When using the @time macro on independent bits of the function, it is apparent that every part is really fast up until it hits the loop at the end that actually calculations the convolution. This loop is incredibly slow either way I do it, be that using matrix multiplication over the circulant kernel, a double nested loop in combination with the <code>sum()</code> function, or a triple nested loop that does the sum itself.</p>

<p>There is some strange slicing of the padded signal in the sense that the padding at early time flips to the end of the time extension after convolution.

The differential equations to be solved sits in the plant model which is a equation based mathematical model. The solver settings are 'Euler' '1e-6' time interval. I am able to develop the controller and model in MATLAB Simulink properly but with a causal approach. The controller is  fast changing system and plant being a physical entity is slow moving.

<p>I get the error: Intermediate brace {} indexing produced a comma-separated list with 2 values, but it must produce a single value to

<p>The two lines before that work perfectly fine:</p>
<pre><code>test1 = tables{ch_pos};
test1 = test1.cycle_no;
</code></pre>
<p>And get the result I want.</p>
<p>Since the function returns the cell array I try to access, I also tried it with the output in  the console and that works as well:</p>
<pre><code>tablesO = dataEinlesen(tcoFile)
test1 = tablesO{1,1}.cycle_no
</code></pre>
<p>So why doesnt</p>
<pre><code>test1 = tables{ch_pos}.cycle_no;

<p>work inside the function? What am I missing?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Tables at that point is a {2501x18 table, [], [], []; 2501x18 table, [], [], []; 2501x18 table, [], [], []; 2501x18 table, [], [], []} cell , so a 2501x18 table at {1,1}, {2,1}, {3,1} and {4,1}</p>
<pre><code>test1 = tables{ch_pos}
</code></pre>
<p>returns a 2501x18 table and</p>
<pre><code>test1 = test1.cycle_no
</code></pre>
<p>makes test1 to a 2501x1 double</p>
<p>Also as said before, the function returns tables as output and when Im doing the same òne-line thing in the console to the output:</p>
<pre><code>test1 = tables{1,1}.cycle_no
</code></pre>
<p>It works and directly returns the 2501x1 double</p>
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p>A complete and minimal example:</p>
<pre><code>function tables = testTables()
%UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
tableData = zeros(2501,18);
tableData(:,1) = 0:2500;

test1 = tables{1,1};
test1 = test1.cycle_no;

<p>The column in question is exactly the same as in my other function. All other columns are just 0s for simplicity. Oddly enough its working perfectly fine in this example case.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
My connections and program are right. I found out that the stepper motor driver (DM320T) I used requires a digital signal voltage of 4-5v (for High) for PUL. However, the raspberry pi digital pin doles out a 0-3.3v. In effect, it was still read by the DM320T as a Low. </p>

<p>As a result, I switched to an Arduino Micro which has a digital pin voltage of 0-5v and capable of providing the requirement for PUL. </p>

Therefore it has to be built as standalone C-Code using the Matlab Coder. This code is then called to start the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>What I need:</strong> I need to find a way to initialize my built model with ~500 parameters. These change with each simulation run and are stored in a SQLite file. The goal is to have parameters written to the database, then start the Model which reads the parameters from SQLite during initialization (presumably using the InitFcn Model Callback, although I'm open to alternatives).</p>
<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Direct SQL interface: I tried to use a direct Matlab-SQL interface such as JDBC (since I don't have access to the Database-toolbox) but those are <a href=""https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/functions-and-objects-supported-for-cc-code-generation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not supported</a> for Code generation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write a C-function that reads the SQLite file, then call the function during initialization in the InitFcn Callback using <a href=""https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/coder.ceval.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coder.ceval</a> like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>   data = 0;
   err = coder.ceval('read_function',4, 2, 12, coder.wref(data));
   parameter = data;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Problem here is that <code>coder.wref</code> is not supported in Matlab and therefore doesn't work in the InitFcn. (Please correct me if I'm wrong)
This only seems to work inside a Matlab-Function-Block:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>   Error evaluating 'InitFcn' callback of block_diagram 'Model'.
   Caused by:
   The coder.wref function is not supported in MATLAB.
</code></pre>
<p>So my problem with the second approach is, that I can't call the C-function during initialization.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Using a Matlab-function-Block to read the parameters isn't really an option, since I would have to route all the signals out which makes maintaining and further development of the model really hard. Also my  suggestion is, that the model would not even run because the parameters are needed to initialize the model.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a way to make one of the above approaches work? If yes, how? Where is my mistake?</li>
<li>Is there another (simpler) option to pass the data as an array or struct to my model?</li>
</ol>

<p>I then applied these kernels and did 2D convolution with my image. </p>

<p>I am not sure what to do next, should I need to represent eigen values and vectors by using D_xx,D_yy and D_xy? How can we pull out ridge lines from the image by using the eigen analysis of 2-by-2 matrix for each pixel?
Any idea, formula or even code will be much helpful. </p>

<p>The <code>caminho.concat</code> has the function of concatenating the string to pass the parameter on the same line, according to the image changes in each folder and so on. However, I do not know if it is the best way to do this, considering the construction of the test.m string and passing its parameters. In short, I am confused about how to do the integration.</p>
<p>I made a code sketch in Matlab, so that I could call the script to pass the necessary parameters, but I'm not sure of that since I don't have much experience with the language. The following is the matlab script:</p>
<pre><code>function sh = SuperpixelHierarchy(image, edge, edge_weight, compactness, labels, borders)
    arguments
        image 
        edge
        edge_weight
        compactness
        labels
        borders
    end
    sh = SuperpixelHierarchyMex(image, edge, edge_weight, compactness);
    imgdir =  dir(fullfile(image,'*.jpg'));
    imgname = {imgdir.name};
    imwrite(sh.label, borders);
    color1 = MeanColor(double(image), sh.label);
    imwrite(sh.label, labels);
    fusion = imfuse(color1, sh.label,'ColoChannels', [R G B]);
    imwrite(fusion, imgname+&quot;SUPERPIXELS_LABELS.jpg&quot;);
end
</code></pre>
<p>I want to make an extração of superpixels from a method called Superpixels Hierarchy (SH) that is written in Matlab. So, I need to use the input parameters to calculate these superpixels and use the outputs from this method as input for the next stages of the Java program ...</p>
<p>Could you help me with the construction of the String and understanding of this integration for the extraction of superpixels as my program? Since I thank you.</p>

We are currently running into an issue where the amount of welders used is going to infinity, and will always equal whatever upper limit we set. Here is the equation we are optimizing, along with the constraints and the call to fmincon()
We would optimally like the equation to find the best balance between days and welders, not just maximize the amount of welders possible. Are we going about this optimization the wrong way, is there a better method?
Optimally we would like to be able to set these variables as integers, which as far as I'm aware can't be done without MATLABs Global Optimization Toolbox but we aren't sure if the other aspects of what we are doing would be possible within the bounds of that toolbox. Sadly, due to the project funding it is likely we only have the ability to get permanent access to one of the 2 toolboxes, so we want to know what would be possible and how we would be best suited to make this work.</p>

<p>Running this program will always give you the maximum bound of 15 welders, while making days as low as possible (13.3333 in this scenario). If we unbound the welders, it will put it into the 10000's of welders (will continue to run forever, we could set a lower bound of 1 for days, but it will just minimize days to 1, which is obviously not anything close to realistic), just to make days as small as possible</p>

<p>I am trying to compare two lists of company names and have created a sequence of <code>if</code> statements within a <code>for</code> loop, with a <code>contains()</code> function in the <code>if</code> statements.</p>
<p>The logic is that for each company name X in the original list, the <code>if</code> statements will be computed:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>if</code> : If there is a match in the top 50 of both lists, then I get the name of the company with the statement &quot;X is in the 2020 top 50 list&quot;.</li>
<li><code>elseif</code> : If there is a match in the top 50 of the original list and the rest of the secondary list then I get the name  of the company with the statement &quot;X is in the 2020 overall list&quot;</li>
<li><code>else</code> : If there is no match, I get the name of the company that did not match with the statement &quot;X is not in the 2020 list&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>As of now my output is all the companies that are matches but with statement in (3) i.e. my <code>else</code> statement. Not sure why, but my <code>else</code> statement is capturing my <code>if</code> and <code>elseif</code> statement output.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>year1 = data(1:end, 1:4); %tables
year30 = data(1:end, 121:124);
names30_50 = year30{1:50, 2}; %cells
names30_all = year30{:, 2};
names1_50 = year1{1:50, 2};
names1_all = year1{:, 2};


for i = 1:height(names1_50)
    if contains(names30_50, names1_50{i})  %comparing both top 50 lists
        disp(names1_50{i})
        fprintf('%s is in the 2020 top 50 list.\n',names1_50{i})

</code></pre>

<p>I read a bit about what Protobuf is, what it does and that it obviously is part of TensorFlow, but I don't have any clue why I could possibly have some version mismatch here. I installed everything inside a virtualenv and reinstalled the <strong>tensorflow</strong> and <strong>protobuf</strong> packages back and forth several times in different versions to no avail. This is an excerpt of the currently installed relevant packages:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Package               Version
--------------------- ----------
gpflow                0.5

protobuf              3.12.2
tensorflow            1.15.3
tensorflow-estimator  1.15.1
</code></pre>

<p>Strange enough I don't even know why the error message states I have Protobuf version 3.6.1 installed, though the protobuf package clearly is a later version and I don't know where this 3.6.1 version could hide on my system. What's more interesting is that the code works like a charm as long as the MATLAB engine is not involved. But as soon as I just make one single call to <code>engine.eval(…)</code> it's over and the code goes south. Interestingly the code still works as long as I just initialize the engine and don't exchange any data with it</p>

<p>I already have used the MATLAB engine on another optimization task using scikit-opt earlier, where I basically did the same (fetch a function result from a MATLAB script and process it in Python) and it worked flawlessly. But somehow it refuses to co-exist with TensorFlow and I don't know where to look into.</p>

<p>I'm happy to provide more information if needed and maybe there is someone out there who has experience with TensorFlow+Protobuf+MATLAB and knows what it's all about.</p>

The link  for that question is here : <a href=""https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/829233-how-do-i-invert-a-non-uniform-fft-using-the-nufft-function?s_tid=prof_contriblnk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/829233-how-do-i-invert-a-non-uniform-fft-using-the-nufft-function?s_tid=prof_contriblnk</a></p>
<p>Due to the relationship between the Z-transform and the nufft (on the wikipedia page for the non uniform DFT), I also tried building the Z-transform matrix. This is the code for the Z-transform matrix, but I reckon it should be correct since it aligns with the nufft.</p>
<pre><code>function[D] = buildZMatrix(x, freq)
% buildZMatrix(x, freq) :   this function builds the matrix for the non 
%                           uniform fft.
% INPUT:
% x:        The points in space.
% freq:     The query points in the fourier side.
%
% OUTPUT:   
% D:        The matrix of possible z points.

[X, Y] = meshgrid(x, freq);
fun =@(x, y) exp(-1i * 2 * pi * x .* y);
D = fun(X, Y)';
end
</code></pre>
<p>I had tried it beforehand, and an issue I had was that sometimes this matrix would be too close to a singular matrix, and this gave me problems when inverting. I suspected that some points would be too close to one another in some distributions I tried. Nevertheless, I wrote an example, showing that the matrix computation was the same as the nufft. Unfortunately, both seem wrong... Indeed, the transform of a Gaussian should be Gaussian-shaped, and the result in the plot doesn't look Gaussian-shaped. In the image <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qfy5K.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nufft_comparison_plots</a>, I don't understand why the Gaussian curve seems translated. Is this a normal behaviour that is to be expected due to different distributions of points ?</p>
<p>This is the code to obtain this plot and compute the nufft :
First I used a square function to obtain a non equispaced mapping.</p>
<pre><code>N = 2048;
dim = [-pi pi];

% Map the points
xnodes = linspace(dim(1), dim(2), N);
map1 =@(x) sign(x).* x.^2;
xnodes = map1(xnodes);


% The length of the domain. 
L = xnodes(end) - xnodes(1);
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fixed a spectrum on the same number of points N, and fixed a scaling factor motivated by the fft function, and it seemed to be adequate for equispaced points (I mentioned it in the question I linked).</p>
<pre><code>%% frequencies
% Fix a spectrum
k = linspace(-8, 8, N);

%% Attempt of scaling factor for the Fourier transform
% scaling factor for equispaced
J = k(end) - k(1);
J3 = k(end-1) - k(1);
fac =  (L * J)/(N*J3);
%% Build Z matrix
D = buildZMatrix(xnodes, k);
</code></pre>
<p>Then I computed the various elements to plot, I wrote the analytical form of the Fourier transform of the Gaussian that I chose.</p>
<pre><code>%% Create the function vectors
% Sine function
Us = sin(xnodes);

% cosine
Uc = cos(xnodes);

% Guassian
gauss =@(x) exp(-x.^2);
Ug = gauss(xnodes);

% The analytical expression for the Fourier transform.
tr_gauss =@(x) sqrt(pi) * exp(-(pi * x).^2);

%% Compute the Fourier transforms 
% Sine
Us_nufft =   fac * nufft(Us, xnodes, k);

% Cosine
Uc_nufft = fac * nufft(Uc, xnodes, k);
Uc_D = abs(fac * complex(Uc) * D);

% Gaussian
Ug_nufft =  fac * nufft(Ug, xnodes, k);
Ug_D = abs(fac * complex(Ug) * D);

% Analytical fourier transform of Gaussian
fftg = tr_gauss(k);
</code></pre>
<p>This last part is just to obtain the plots.</p>
<pre><code>%% Plot on the fourier side
fig5 = figure('units', 'normalized', 'Outerposition', [0.15 0.05 0.7 0.9]);

The project involves an app (built using MATLAB app designer) which has a lift keypad with numbers from 1 to 9 and a text box which should show the current floor. Clicking a button changes an input constant in Simulink model which then goes into a Stateflow model. The Stateflow model simulates the lift moving across the floors and updates the output &quot;floor&quot; and displays it in a display block. I have no idea how to make the current floor output update the app's text box continuously. When using simout block, I am able to check the current floor by pressing a &quot;Check floor&quot; button only when I pause the simulink model. Is there a way to make simulink update the text box automatically with the current floor number?</p>

Using e.g., periodic timers, this can be easily achieved (see below), however I cannot delete the timer when the user presses <code>CTRL+C</code> during the <code>pause(3.1)</code> (and the continued execution of <code>update_countdown</code> would lead to confusing results, deleting characters in the console instead of just displaying the update time)</p>

<ul>
<li>a handle that can be detected as deleted and</li>
<li>a <code>CloseRequestFcn()</code> - a function that can be specified to run <em>after</em> a figure has been closed,</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect something like this <em>ought to exist</em> for functions.

For a project I need to finish a script that uses two matrices the &quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;searchArea&quot; to determine the displacement of the interventricular septum of the heart using the blockchaining method with multiple frames of the cardiac cycle. The &quot;kernel&quot; is a fraction of the orginal frame image and the &quot;searchArea&quot; is an area thats surrounds the kernel in the next frame. I have to use cross correlation to do this and already tried the following (this process will be repeated for all the frames):</p>
<pre><code>crossCor = xcorr2(searchArea,kernel);
[max_cc,imax] = max(abs(crossCor(:)));
[ypeak, xpeak] = ind2sub(size(crossCor),imax(1));
            
dispLat = ypeak-size(kernel,1)
dispAx = xpeak-size(kernel,2)

</code></pre>
<p>This code was writen based on the xcorr2 documentation: <a href=""https://nl.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/xcorr2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://nl.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/xcorr2.html</a></p>
<p>The code does work but the results do not meet my expectations, the script that I got provided with uses the lateral displacement (x displacement) and axial displacement (y displacement) to create tracking frames:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eo2W3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eo2W3.png"" alt=""frame 1"" /></a>

<p>The results should show the displacement of the septum just like in frame 1, but you can see that in frame 2 and 3 the displacement is way off.</p>
<p>I do not know if I'm on the right track here of giving the provided script the right displacements, but any advice or nudges in the right direction are welcome!</p>
<p>REMARK:
I am doing this for an introductory medical imaging course, the blue colored mesh which is used to plot the movement is created using speckle tracking, however I did not get any details on how this works which is probably intended. The Matlab script relies on the right input of axial (y) and lateral (x) displacement, the results are wrong, so my written code is probably (partly) wrong. My main intension to post this on stackoverflow is to receive feedback on my written code, because I don't know what I have done wrong.</p>

<p>What I have so far is:</p>
<pre><code>% Original values from spreadsheet

I have a set of 3-D scattered data which needs to be interpolated in 3 dimensions (x,y,z); this seems to be attainable by both Python and MATLAB using griddata. In MATLAB I can write:</p>
<pre><code>plot_variable_out = griddata(x_in,y_in,z_in,plot_variable,x_out,y_out,z_out,'nearest');
</code></pre>
<p>While in Python I found another question about this issue <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47235152/how-to-interpolate-3d-using-pythons-griddata"">here</a> and I can write:</p>
<pre><code>plot_variable_out = griddata((x_in, y_in, z_in), plot_variable, (x_out, y_out, z_out), 'linear')
</code></pre>
<p>I used two different interpolation methods as in Python I saw that linear interpolation was also working and gave better results aside from being much faster. The issue is the same when using 'nearest' in Python.
The problem is that in Python the griddata-interpolated variable extremes can change a lot. As an example, these are the extremes for variable 1 prior to interpolation:</p>
<pre><code>94.629, 39197.3
</code></pre>
<p>The griddata-interpolated extremes in MATLAB are:</p>
<pre><code>94.629, 39197.3
</code></pre>
<p>The griddata-interpolated extremes in Python are:</p>
<pre><code>95.871, 38126.674
</code></pre>
<p>In another case the relative variation is much larger, basically flattening the values. These are the base values:</p>
<pre><code>19.195, 22.503
</code></pre>
<p>The griddata-interpolated extremes in MATLAB are:</p>
<pre><code>19.195, 22.503
</code></pre>
<p>The griddata-interpolated extremes in Python are:</p>
<pre><code>20.088, 20.201
</code></pre>
<p>It could be that this is not the only approach to the problem and there are other functions which could be used for this case. I used griddata as in the Python documentation it seems that it can be used for unstructured N*N data, which is my case. It could also be that the slightly different griddata syntax is the cause of the problem here, using (x, y, z) instead of x, y, z in the python griddata function call, but then I don't understand why it works so differently. Could anyone help me with this issue? Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p>I would like to assign to each combination a unique value (hash, ranking), so that I can check if the same combinations appear in different tables. Different combinations are not allowed to have same value assigned, i.e. no collisions. I have to make a lot of such comparisons between a lot of such tables. So, for performance reasons, I would like to accomplish this by vectorization of <code>uint32</code> operations to make it suitable for GPU acceleration in MATLAB.</p>
<p>Things I have thought of so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lexicographic ranking: no idea how to vectorize the standard fast recursive algorithms well, and the only option seems to be to <code>parfor</code> it through the rows, which is slower than other options. IIRC, the direct explicit formula, though vectorizable, requires computation of binomials, which in turn requires <code>log Gamma</code> function in order to avoid huge factorials + <code>double</code> type to avoid collision if I am not mistaken, i.e. is slower because it's 'very numerical'.</li>
<li>Cantor pairing function: one can successively apply Cantor's pairing, which is nice because it's a polynomial expression, but it produces huge numbers well beyond <code>uint32</code> and is definitely slower than other options.</li>
<li>Base 51 (no pun intended) integers: sends a combination/row vector <code>(x_1,...,x_6)</code> to <code>x_1 + x_2 * 51 + ... + x_6 * 51^5</code>. This is the fastest I currently have. It's easily vectorizable, but unfortunately still requires <code>uint64</code> or <code>double</code> for rank-6 combinations of 50 elements, which is slower than <code>uint32</code> or <code>single</code> type operations would be.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The choice of type does not impact the GPU-accelerated search via <code>ismember</code> (expected), however there is a noticeable difference in the ranking speed coming from the matrix multiplication. Ranking in <code>single</code> is almost twice as fast as ranking in <code>double</code>, while ranking in <code>uint32</code> is nearly the same as ranking in <code>double</code>. MATLAB does not currently support GPU-accelerated <code>uint32</code> matrix multiplication, so I am using a substitute function for this. Thus, it is much more reasonable to try to encode combinations of 50 elements of order 6 as <code>single</code> values, which, if I am not mistaken, has just enough bits to accomodate all 15890700 combinations as <code>single</code> integers.</p>

<p>I would have expected one array to be pivoted respect to the other (1x2 versus 2x1) but they seem equal despite dimension differences. Also, if you visualize them in MATLAB Workspace, they both render as a table with rows 1 and 2, and columns &quot;name&quot; and &quot;lastname&quot; (I thought I would get columns 1 and 2, and rows name and lastname).</p>

<p>How is it that 1x2 versus 2x1 makes no difference at all? In other languages, if you try to iterate a matrix with the typical indexes <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, in one case <code>i</code> would loop up to 2, and in the other it would be <code>j</code>, they will definitely not be equal.</p>

My problem is the following:
I have two data matrices, a neural activity (nsubjects x nbrain_areas) and a set of neuropsychological testing (nsubjects x ntests). My general idea was to investigate the relationship between these two matrices. Threfore I was thinking to use Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR). From what I have understood with PLSR it is possible to reduce the data identifyng the components explaining the covariance between two sets of variables.
I used the plsregress in Matlab, however I am not sure how to interpret correctly the results.
I used 10 components for the PLSR with k-fold cross validation and motecarlo repetion.</p>

<p>The second row of the PCTVAR output should explain the variance explained in Y by the PLS components. The first 4 components explain the 90% of the variance.
My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>how can I know which test of my neuropsychological matrix is contributing the most to the components, and how could I select it based on a statistical parameter?</li>
<li>Based on the PLSR results, how could I know which part of X (neural activity) is maximally correlated with Y (neuropsychological tests)?</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact if I select the the variables contributing the most to the four components based on the value of YL (Y loading), which is the metric based on what I select a variable and to reject another? And once I selected the variables of Y (neuropschycological test) which are maximally expressed in the components, what could I say about their relationship with X (neural activity)?</p>

Basically, I have to go through each array element, average the four elements around it and put that averaged value in the original location [so basically for an arbitrary point Vi,j = 1/4(Vi+1,j + Vi-1,j + Vi,j+1 + Vi, j-1)]. However, the problem slightly changes when the distance of separation to each grid point changes. The issue becomes one of weighted averages. Let us take a look at a simple &quot;diagram&quot; I made for myself in Excel.</p>
<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/5zwCg0Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Click for pictorial representation of a Parallel Plate Grid</a></p>
<p>Here, the overall array starts zero-filled, except for the last row which is filled with the constant 8000. Similarly, the Zeroth (or first in MATLAB) row is filled with constant 0s. The last and zeroth rows do not change. The code starts by averaging values and over iterations will converge to the correct solution. As can be seen or inferred, the values will not change much along the 'X'-axis (also true since it is an equipotential surface). The change will be in the 'Y'-axis. Thus, I could basically calculate the grid by changing from the eight (8) columns shown to only one (1) column and should drastically increase the number of rows so that I can have a &quot;finer&quot;/more detailed/higher resolution analysis. This is where my problem lies. I cannot figure out how to &quot;resize the grid&quot;. Here is my code (The comments have some references to the pictorial representation provided earlier):</p>
<pre><code>% Description: Graphing the potential between
% two parallel plates of set voltages (boundary conditions) using FDM.
% I have considered the area under observation as a grid/array/matrix
% as shown in the accompanying photos. Each element of the matrix gives the
% magnitude of the potential at that very point. 

% The matrix starts off zero-filled, and the boundary conditions are set 
% (in this case, two parallel edges of the matrix are set to 8 kV and 0 kV
% to represent equipotential surfaces). Since the potential is only
% changing in one direction/axes, the magnitude of each grid element can be
% calculated relatively easily.

% The output graph is a 3D graph. The X and Y axes show the map of the
% region. The Z axis shows the strength of electric potential at every
% given unit grid on the X-Y plane. 

% Initial Setup
clc;
clear all;
close all;

% xAxisResolution and yAxisResolution showcase how fine I want to calculate
% the field for. For example, in the attached photo, potential changes
% substantially more drastically over the y axis, but does not change with
% change of x axis. Thus, my yAxisResolution is great by a factor of 10. 
xAxisResolution = 5*10^0;
yAxisResolution = 5*10^1;

% Creating the grid I want to calculate my potential strength over and
% zero-filling.
fieldArray = zeros (yAxisResolution, xAxisResolution);

% Setting up the Initial Conditions. Since one of the parallel plates is
% 0kV, and the matrix is already zero-filled, I do not need to do anything.
% For the second plate, the voltage is set to 8 kV. 
for column = 1:xAxisResolution
    fieldArray(1, column) = 8000;
end

% FDM Calculation
% iterator - Number of times that the whole grid/array is
% refreshed/updated. For best results, use 1:10^5
% To improve accuracy, some boundary condition if statements are added.
% They are described below. 

for iterator = 1:10^4
    for row = 1:(yAxisResolution) % Traverses each row
        for column = 1:(xAxisResolution) % Traverses each column in every row

            % Case #1: Check to see if the current row being traversed is 
            % the user-provided initial/boundary condition. In my case, I
            % am testing two parallel plates at two edges. (Colored RED in 
            % photo) They are 0 kV and 8kV respectively and cannot be 
            % changed. Thus, when the loop encounters these edges, nothing 
            % is changed and break condition is encountered. 
            if (row == 1) || (row == yAxisResolution) 
                break

            % Case #2: Checks to see if the current column is on the edge. 
            % If so, there will only be 3 adjacent elements, and the 
            % stencil is changed. This is accounted for with a specific
            % formula to account for stencil change (average of only 3
            % adjacent elements).
            % (Colored YELLOW in photo)
            elseif (column == 1)
                fieldArray(row, column) = (fieldArray(row+1, column) + fieldArray(row-1, column) + fieldArray(row, column+1))/3;

                fieldArray(row, column) = (fieldArray(row+1, column) + fieldArray(row-1, column) + fieldArray(row, column-1))/3;

            % Case #3: Checks to see if the current element is at any other
            % position of the matrix/grid that can be changed/overwritten
            % that has 4 adjacent elements. These elements are accounted
            % for by their specific averaging formula (4 elements).

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/5452HLt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The code output can be seen by clicking this hyperlink.</a></p>
<p>As can be seen from this output, the grid is resized to have 50 units in the 'Y' axis and 5 units in the 'X' axis. I however want to calculate the potential over a constant length (like, a 5 meter x 1 meter area) but want to divide it into varying grids. Basically, the end goal is to have a script that can take real-world physical dimensions of length, assign them to either 'X' or 'Y' axes, and then change the resolution of calculation. I have tried to use linspace in Matlab to generate a vector, but it got really confusing really fast since I didn't know how to make a 2D matrix from the same. I also tried to change how I address the locations. By this I mean, sure the matrix is 50x5, but I can label it 5x5, and accommodate that in the other areas of my program (the weighted average portion). However, my implementation did not work at all and messed my program up even more.</p>

I have a 2D parameter space <code>(x,y)</code>, over which I solve this equation at every point.
Then I take the dot product of an eigenvector and the discretized time derivative of another eigenvector along a trajectory in <code>(x,y)</code>. For example, if my matrix is <code>4 x 4</code>, and I get eigenvectors <code>A, B, C, D</code> with eigenvalues <code>a, b, c, d</code>, I am talking about <code>(A).(dB/dt)</code> (which is usually complex-valued). Then I calculate its complex argument/angle.</p>
<p>As long as my <code>(x,y)</code> points are sufficiently close enough (i.e. 'continuous'), and as long as I know that the eigenvalues of each eigenfunction considered are unique at every point along the trajectory (i.e. <code>a =/= b</code> at for all <code>(x,y)</code> making the trajectory), I can expect this angle to be a continuous quantity as well, without any sharp jumps (as in the first figure). However, when using Numpy/Scipy it seems as if this 'continuous' quality is ruined by a degenerate/repeating eigenvalue <strong>even if it is not on the trajectory</strong>. That is, if my trajectory comprises <code>{(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4),(x5,y5)}</code>, with unique eigenvalues at each point (i.e. <code>a1 =/= b1, a2 =/= b2, ...</code>), it seems as if that <code>a9 = b9</code> at <code>(x9, y9)</code> causes trouble even if <code>(x9, y9)</code> is not on the trajectory considered.
I deduced this by changing my matrix so that the eigenvalues of each eigenfunction are unique at each point (i.e. I forced <code>a9 =/= b9</code>). Doing so gave me a 'continuous' angle. On the contrary, both cases are 'continuous' in MATLAB, as expected in theory.</p>
<p>It seems as if the issue is with the complex phases assigned to the numerical eigenfunctions. I used <code>np.unwrap</code> to delve into this more (last figure below), but it wasn't too fruitful.
I have spent weeks trying to understand why, to no avail. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>But the resulting curves are non-monotonic (I would include an image but I'm new here and so I'm not allowed).
Coould you perhaps help me out, please? How can I do the interpolation so that the curves are monotonic (the slope is preserved?). I tired to convert to cartesian and interpolate there, but that didn't work very well either.</p>

<p>This process I've described is to be done at the same time another program runs, and this program is the one that writes the data in the first file. This program updates the data file quickly, overwriting the data in order to write the same amount of lines each time, and the MATLAB code has to get every line added. While the other program runs, MATLAB  code has a <code>while(true)</code> loop. The loop ends when a certain condition is met, and the condition is derived from the data in the file.</p>
<p>The problem is that when I run both programs in order to make them work together, after some time MATLAB code stops outputting the result it should output, while it's still running.
For some time the command window shows the result correctly, then it stops, and if I go to the workspace window, the variables are still there but their value is empty, it's blank. If I press Ctrl+C to stop the code, the values of the variables appear again.</p>

<p>I need a resulting vector to be comprised from values out of both vectors based on a condition from the third vector. Let's assume this is the condition: <code>vec_cond &gt;= 0</code></p>
<p>Then if this is true, I want <code>vec_result</code> to have values from <code>vec1</code> on appropriate indexes, and if not, take values from <code>vec2</code> on appropriate indexes:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>vec_result = vec1 if (vec_cond &gt;=0) else vec2
</code></pre>
<p>This is portion of my MATLAB script (original comments were Czech) where I would need to use that:</p>
<pre class=""lang-matlab prettyprint-override""><code>%% Draw output current and voltage characteristics
R       = 100:5:2*10^3;             % Load rezistor          [ohm]
U_2     = R .* (I * 10^(-3));       % Load voltage             [V]
U_1stab = U_LM + U_x + U_2;         % Min. required input voltage
                                    % for stabilization        [V]
U_delta = U_1 - U_1stab;            % Difference between actual and

U_2norm = U_1 - U_LM - U_x          % Calculating output load

I_r1    = I * I_z.^0;               % Stabilizator current    [mA]
</code></pre>
<p>So the condition would be <code>U_delta &gt;= 0</code>.</p>
<p>I tried to use a ternary operator, which I found <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/problems/44243-ternary-conditional-operator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-matlab prettyprint-override""><code>I_graph = (U_delta &gt;= 0) : (@() I) : (@() I_z);         % Current splice  [mA]
U_graph = (U_delta &gt;= 0) : (@() U_2) : (@() U_2norm);   % Voltage splice   [V]
</code></pre>
<p>That means that for <code>I_graph</code>, if the condition is met, take a constant value <code>I</code> and vectorize it, otherwise take values from <code>I_z</code> vector. For <code>U_graph</code>, if the condition is met, take values from <code>U_2</code> vector, otherwise take constant value of <code>U_2norm</code> and vectorize it.</p>
<p>But it didn't work, this is what it tells me:</p>
<pre><code>Operator ':' is not supported for operands of type 'function_handle'.

Error in vypocet1 (line 52)
I_graph = (U_delta &gt;= 0) : (@() I) : (@() I_z);         % Current splice  [mA]
</code></pre>
<p>I guess that I might want to use <code>for</code> loop, but I'm not sure how it will help me and how can I actually construct the necessary vector using a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>I suspect that the problem has something to do with the initial guess that is being passed to the different iterations (see commented lines inside the loop in the <code>analysis</code> function). I try to set the solution of an iteration as the initial guess for the following (which must reduce the time needed for the solver), but it is even slower, which I don't understand. Maybe I missed something, because it is my first time trying to solve differential equations.</p>
<p>The parameters used for the execution are the following:</p>
<pre><code>f2 = h5py.File(r'path/to/file', 'r')
k = np.array(f2['k']).squeeze()
z = np.array(f2['z']).squeeze()
f2.close()

analysis_points = 501
max_mesh = 1e6 

beta_0 = 3e2; 
beta_low = 0;       # Lower value of the frequency for the analysis
beta_up = beta_0;   # Upper value of the frequency for the analysis
beta_analysis = np.linspace(beta_low, beta_up, analysis_points);

s11_analysis, s21_analysis = analysis(k, z, beta_analysis, max_mesh)
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas on how to improve the performance of these functions? Thank you all in advance, and sorry if the question is not well-formulated, I accept any suggestions about this.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Added some information about performance and sizing of the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>In practice, I can't find a relation that determines de number of times <code>coupling_equation</code> is called. It must be a matter of the internal operation of the solver. I checked the number of callings in one iteration by printing a line, and it happened in 133 ocasions (this was one of the fastests). This must be multiplied by the number of iterations of beta. For the analyzed one, the solver returned this:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Solved in 11 iterations, number of nodes 529.
Maximum relative residual: 9.99e-04
Maximum boundary residual: 0.00e+00</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The shapes of <code>a</code> and <code>z_mesh</code> are correlated, since z_mesh is a vector whose length corresponds with the size of the mesh, recalculated by the solver each time it calls <code>coupling_equation</code>. Given that <code>a</code> contains the amplitudes of the progressive and regressive waves at each point of <code>z_mesh</code>, the shape of <code>a</code> is <code>(2, len(z_mesh))</code>.</li>
<li>In terms of computation times, I only managed to achieve 19 iterations in about 2 hours with Python. In this case, the initial iterations were faster, but they start to take more time as their mesh grows, until the point that the mesh saturates to the maximum allowed value. I think this is because of the value of the input coupling coefficients in that point, because it also happens when no loop in <code>beta_analysis</code>is executed (just the <code>solve_bvp</code> function for the intermediate value of beta). Instead, Matlab managed to return a solution for the entire problem in just 6 minutes, aproximately. If I pass the result of the last iteration as <code>initial_guess</code> (commented lines in the <code>analysis</code> function, the mesh overflows even faster and it is impossible to get more than a couple iterations.</li>

<li>Does the duration of an audio signal affect the amplitude of frequency components of that same signal? For example, I am recording the sound of a fan using a microphone. At first, I record only for 10 sec and convert the audio signal into frequency spectrum. Then, I record the same sound for 20 sec and then convert the audio signal into frequency spectrum. In both the cases, the sound of the fan is same, but does the duration of the signal affect the amplitude of frequency components in the spectrum plot?</li>
<li>For example, I have 2 audio signals. For the first one, I have that same fan sound recording for 10 sec and the sampling frequency is 5KHz, and for the second recording, I have that same audio signal but now the sampling frequency is changed to 15KHz. I used MATLAB to check the power for both the signals and the power for both the signals was same, however I want to know why. Formula that I used was <code> Power=rms(signal)^2</code>. According to me the second signal should have more power because now there are more number of samples compared to the first recording and since those extra samples would also have a random amplitude, the average shouldn't be  the same as for the first one.

<p>The function currently looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>function points = distMidPoint(parents, distMax)

child = mean(parents);

if any(vecnorm(parents - child,2,2) &lt;= distMax)
% check if distance to the parents falls below a certain threshold
    points = [];
    return
end

points = child;

for iParents = nchoosek(1:size(parents,1),size(parents,1)-1)'
% concatenate child and any combination of two parents and call function again
    newPoint = distMidPoint([parents(iParents,:); child], distMax);
    points = [points; newPoint];

722,723,1620303875.0,Stack Overflow,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67418072/matlab-efficiency-small-for-loop,Matlab efficiency: small for-loop,"<p>I wrote some Matlab code that works so far, but is very slow when running with a big matrix. I identified the bottleneck of my code as a for-loop.</p>
<p>What the code is supposed to do is look at one column (ic) of the H-matrix, compare with other columns that have at least one 1-entry in common with ic and add their ones to the ic vector. This happens until there are no more changes in the ic vector.</p>
<p>Here is a small example:</p>
<p>H = ( 1 0 1 ; 1 1 0 ; 0 0 1 ) and ic = ( 1 1 0 )^T (the first column of H). The code then takes for example the first 1 of ic, compares in its row if another column also has a 1 as its first entry, finds the third column ( 1 0 1 )^T and then adds all of the ones to the ic vector that are in the found column, in this case the third entry, so that ic = ( 1 1 1 )^T.</p>
<p>At first I used two for-loops:</p>
<p><em>H</em> is a (500 x 1000) sparse matrix (but is supposed to be (5000 x 10 000) when the code runs faster).</p>
<p><em>ic</em> is a (500 x 1) vector.</p>
<p><em>i</em> is the index of the ic vector the code starts with.</p>
<p>Code 1 (old version):</p>
<pre><code>for c = find(ic).'
     for v = find(H(c,:))
          if v ~= i
              ic = ic | H(:,v);
          end
     end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then I tried to improve my code and make it faster with vectorization:</p>
<p>Code 2 (new version):</p>
<pre><code>for c = find(ic).'
     ic( sum(H(:,find(H(c,:))'),2) &gt; 0 ) = 1;
end
</code></pre>
<p>The second line of code 2 is called 1769302 times and takes up 97.4% of the time which is 30.568s. It is called that many times because the ic vector has to be determined while constructing the H-matrix and is called almost before any 1 added in the H-matrix.
The time already improved compared to code 1, where the second line took 20.209s and the 4th line took 31.950s. My goal is running my code with a (5000 x 10 000) H-matrix and it not taking longer than 3min.</p>
<p>The H-matrix is built during the runtime of the code. Before almost every 1 that is added to the matrix, the function with the mentioned code in it is called. The ic vector is then updated in a while-loop, until it no longer changes or there are no more zeros in the ic vector. The while-loop looks like this:</p>
<p>Code 3 (context):</p>
<pre><code>ic2 = ic;

while true

     for c = find(ic).'
          ic( sum(H(:,find(H(c,:))'),2) &gt; 0 ) = 1;
     end
     
     if isequal(ic0,ic)
          return;
     end
     ic0 = ic;

     if sum(ic(:,1)) == size(H,1)
          return;
     else
          ic2 = ic;
     end

end
</code></pre>
<p>The only purpose of <em>ic0</em> is comparing <em>ic</em> between iterations.</p>
<p><em>ic2</em> saves the state of <em>ic</em> before it only consists of ones.</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate any answer that could help me further improve the runtime of my code and I apologize for not being very experienced in Matlab programming. Thank you very much for any answer!</p>

<p>First, I read the description in the above link.</p>
<pre><code>X = [1 2 3; 1 2 3; 1 2 3];
Y = X';
mymap = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1; 1 1 0; 0 0 0];
C = [3 4 5; 1 2 5; 5 5 5];

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkTpC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">figure 1</a></p>
<p>It's written that &quot;The color of a face depends on the color at one of its four vertices. Because of this relationship between the vertex colors and face colors, none of the values in the last row and column of C are represented in the plot.&quot;
Therefore, I thought only elements C(1,1), C(1,2), C(2,1) and C(2,2) do matter. The elements C(1,3), C(2,3), C(3,1), C(3,2), C(3,3) do no matter, so I can put any arbitrary number in these places to produce the same image above.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colormap.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colormap.html</a></p>
<p>Second, I read the description in the above link.
It’s written that “To create a custom colormap, specify map as a three-column matrix of RGB triplets where each row defines one color. An RGB triplet is a three-element row vector whose elements specify the intensities of the red, green, and blue components of the color.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought first row [1 0 0] of mymap designates red, and the second row [0 1 0] designates green, and the third row [0 0 1] designates blue, and the fourth row [1 1 0] designates yellow, and the fifth row [0 0 0] designates black. For example, C(1,1)=3 designates the third row of mymap, which is blue. C(2,2)=2 designates second row of mymap, which is green.</p>
<p>Then, based on my understanding, I tried to plot a simple square with a specific color I want.</p>
<pre><code>X = [0 1; 0 1];
Y = [0 0; 1 1];
mymap = [1 0 0; 0 0 0];
C = [1 1 ; 1 1];
pcolor(X, Y, C)
colormap(mymap)
</code></pre>
<p>Based on my understanding, only one element of matrix C would be represented in the plot, and the remaining three elements do not matter. Since all elements are 1, it designates first row of mymap, which is red.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1VeEn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">figure2</a></p>
<p>However, it plots a black square, which is not what I expected.</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, the color matrix C must have only positive integers as its elements, since it should designate specific row of mymap. However, C = [1.4 1.7 ; 1.2 0.1] does not provide any error, and it plots a black square again.</p>
<p>Basically, I do not understand how pcolor, color matrix, and colormap work. I have been Googling for a full day, but I have not understood yet, which is very frustrating. Please help me.</p>

There are a few errors... a) the black border is not opaque, b) transparent colour is set to green not transparent, c) the two images are aligned at the top-left corner but I need them centre aligned.</p>
<p>I have been playing with the alpha level to try and fix the green but I didn't really understand what it meant so didn't get far! I also know this might not be the simplest way to do it so if anyone has any other ideas I would really love to hear them. I am trying to do this in MATLAB because  I already have a script for renaming the files and I would ideally like to combine both into a single script.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>When I run the analysis using a fairly coarse grid resolution 200x200x53 (nx x ny x nz) it takes approximately 11 hours on a single node. This is fine. But I am trying to analyse a finer resolution model, so 1000x1000x75. This means the run time is approximately 25 times longer, so takes ~11 days. Is there a way that I can multithread/parallelise the read in of the netcdf data so that I can run the script using more nodes. Or is there a way to speed up the read in using a different matlab function.</p>

<p>The most commonly suggested trick is to use <code>surf</code> or <code>mesh</code> to create a &quot;fake&quot; 3D line and color this. However, this is not supported on <code>polaraxes</code>in MATLAB:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; polaraxes, hold on;
&gt;&gt; surf([1 1; 1 1], [2 2; 2 2], [3 3; 3 3])

<p>One trick that <em>does</em> seem to work is using a sequence of line segments, as is done in <code>cline.m</code> from File Exchange. <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3747-cline-m"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3747-cline-m</a></p>

<p>My current implementation uses NodeJS <code>'dgram'</code> to receive the data. The implementation below works:</p>
<pre><code>const dgram = require('dgram');
const socket = dgram.CreateSocket('udp4');
socket.on('message', (msg,rinfo) =&gt; {

<p>Hence, my hands are sort of tied, with Matlab I can realistically only send UDP (it's multicast) and I can't get UDP data on the JS side of things.</p>

<p>I've posted a similar problem, initially on Stackexchange; it was moved here and can be found at the link: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67146061/declaring-a-functional-recursive-sequence-in-matlab"">Declaring a functional recursive sequence in Matlab</a>  I'm trying to do something similar in this post, but I've figured that Matlab isn't the place to do it. I'll have to use Pari-GP; and at this point there's no two ways about it.</p>
<p>This is essentially a coding project I've made for myself; which is to effectively numerically evaluate a certain construction of the Tetration function. I've been able to code it fairly well in MatLab; the trouble is, as we are dealing with large numbers like e^e^e^e^e^e^e; these short circuit in MatLab. Pari-GP has a much better understanding of numbers which would usually cause overflows; and I'm now fully realizing why it's used consistently by the Tetration community.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Matlab code works for small numbers and numbers with a niceness to them (well placed imaginary argument). For completeness of this question; the github repository for the matlab code is <a href=""https://github.com/JmsNxn92/Recursive_Tetration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/JmsNxn92/Recursive_Tetration</a>  This isn't the code we want though; I've optimized it further; this isn't up to date totally. But for the purpose of this question, it's enough.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not the best programmer. I haven't programmed since '09, maybe; but I still know my way around. But it's more that I have the framework of coding; and less the actual syntax. Imagine being well acquainted with french philosophy and french writing; but stumbling your words when ordering a cafe.</p>
<p>As to that, I'll stop beating around the bush, and get to the question.</p>
<p>If I define a function <code>beta_function</code> in Pari-GP and write it as,</p>
<pre><code>beta_function(z,l,n) =
{
    out = 0;
    for(i=0,n-1,
        out = exp(out)/(exp(l*(n-i-z)) +1));
    out;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is good, and it works. Now the code for <code>beta_function</code> in MatLab isn't very different. There's nothing more complex being added. As I originally asked for MatLab, I'm asking again for Pari-GP. This is how to code a function <code>tau_K(z,l,n,k)</code>; which is perfectly doable. I'm just missing something obvious.</p>
<p>The code for <code>tau_K(z,l,n,k)</code> in MatLab is attached below. A friendly person on here explained how to do this in MatLab; for those of you interested, I wasn't really defining the recursion properly beforehand. Here is the current MatLab code I'm using,</p>
<pre><code>function f = tau_K(z,l,n,k)
    if k == 1
        f = -log(1+exp(-l*z));
        return
    end

    f = log(1 + tau_K(z+1,l,n,k-1)./beta_function(z+1,l,n)) - log(1+exp(-l*z));
end
</code></pre>
<p>The question is simple. How would one define this recursion in Pari-GP; how do you code this in Pari-GP?</p>
<p>Everything seems to be collapsing towards a return value at 0, when I try to directly translate this code. And honest to god; I know it's just because I'm making some syntax error in how I'm calling the output into the next iteration. I've tried everything I could think of. And the tutorials, they don't seem to be helping. I've tried next to everything. And at this point, I know I'm missing something stupid syntactically.</p>
<p>I'm just hoping someone here would be so helpful as to explain this to me like I'm in kindergarten. I've heard that tail recursion is important here. And if so, how would I code this in? Simply add in a variable which keeps track of everything?</p>
<p>Again, thanks if you got this far into the question.</p>

<p>But it only resulted in this poor picture, which is exactly what I can see, when I try to play the .ravi file in a media player like vlc.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vbj23.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">First try with videorecorder function</a></p>
<p>Then I tried to look at the binary representation of my file and noticed, that I could separate the frames at a certain marker  <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzNAX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beginning of a new frame in binary representation</a></p>
<p>So I tried to read the file with the matlab <code>fread</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>fileID               = fopen(videoPath);    
[headerInfo,~]       = fread(fileID,[1,123392],'uint8');
[imageMatrix,count]  = fread(fileID,[video.width, video.height],'uint16', 'b');
imagesc(imageMatrix')
</code></pre>
<p>Now the image looks better, and you can at least see the brake disc, but it seems, as if the higher temperatures have some kind of offset, that is stil missing, for the picture to be right.</p>
<p>Also, the values that I read from the file are nowhere near actual temperatures, as the other post and the documentation suggests.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NrF9l.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Getting somewhere!</a></p>
<p><strong>My Question</strong></p>
<p>Am I somehow missing something important? Could someone point me in the right direction, where to look or how to get the actual temperatures from my video? As it worked with the cpp code in the other post, I am guessing this might be a matlab problem.</p>

<p>and I need to optimize this array to produce a smoother result with fewer spikes which would be a second array. However, this second array needs to have certain rules, and just randomly making it smoother doesn't work because the following equations govern other parameters that are calculated from this:</p>
<pre><code>d(1,1) = 0;
ED(1,1) = 0;
M(1,1) = 0;
S(1,1) = 0;
d(1,i) = DV(1,i)-EV(1,i);
ED(1,i) = ED(1,i-1) + d(1,i-1);
M(1,i) = ED(1,i) + M(1,i-1);
S(1,i) = -2*(ED(1,i-1)+DV(1,i-1)-EV(1,i-1)+M(1,i-1));
</code></pre>
<p>DV is the second (optimized/smoother) array that I need to create and it has to consist of integers. The results of individual parameters are dependent on previous values. So for example:</p>
<pre><code>ED(1,2) = ED(1,1) + d(1,1) 
M(1,2) = ED(1,2) + M(1,1)
S(1,2) = -2*(ED(1,1)+DV(1,1)-EV(1,1)+M(1,1))
</code></pre>
<p>And I need to create this second array such that the last two values of S will be 0 so:
S(1,42) = 0 &amp;&amp; S(1,41) = 0;</p>
<p>I was first trying to approach this by calculating different permutations but that is not possible to do due to a large number of elements. One fellow from Mathworks suggested a solution using the MATLAB Optimization toolbox. However, if I set up equations as per his suggestions, it does not smooth out the original data and they have a lot of spikes. Another solution would be to use the least-squares method but this method, as well as the first one actually, does not produce integers which is a problem. Is there a way this can be somehow done?</p>

I've looked at some of the methods those tools use for segmentation but their example-images are usually less noisy with better-defined edges and I can't get them to work for me.</p>

<p>The original image on top, and thresholded image on bottom. I need a way to determine the edges of the nuclei (red circles in second image). I am able to detect most other nuclei (with some basic thresholding and image reduction) by using regionprops() to find black circle-like regions. But of course regionprops() doesn't work if the region of interest bleeds into the background. I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>using adaptive thresholding to brighten the cell area (the bright red) and darken the inner-nucleus area (the black circles), but it often amplifies the noise inside the nucleus.</li>
<li>dilating the image, but the gaps are often too big for dilation to close the circle</li>
</ol>
<p>I can play around with the thresholding and dilation to close the circle a bit, but it never becomes fully closed to be detectable by regionprops().</p>

<pre><code>function vnew=mgVcycle(vold,f,alpha1,alpha2,omega,Nmin,N,smoother)
</code></pre>
<p>This is the V-cycle implementation, the central part of the code.You should base your implementation on the recursive implementation.</p>
<p>In this routine, you will first do relaxation on the current level, which has NxN interior points, and then recursively call
the next level, with (N-1)/2 x (N-1)/2 interior points, followed by the coarse grid correction and another relaxation.</p>
<p>vold is the approximation on the current level before the V-cycle, and vnew is the new approximation after the V-cycle. f is the right hand side on the current level (remember, on all levels but the finest, this is the residual vector).</p>
<p>alpha1 and alpha2 are the number of pre- and post-relaxations. Omega is the weight for the weighted Jacobi relaxation.</p>
<p>if N &lt;= Nmin you will do a direct solve (use Matlab's v=A\f). smoother=1 means weighted Jacobi and smoother=2 means Gauss-Seidel.</p>
<p><em><strong>pseudo code</strong></em></p>
<p>Below is my interpretation of pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>if smoother == 1
    Do weighted jacobi alpha1 times on A, vold, f, omega to get vnew
    
    if length(vnew) == (N-1)/2 %coarse grid
       
     Do weighted jacobi alpha 2 times on A,vold,f,omega to get vnew

        find V2h =  by running mgVcycle with error
    
elseif smoother == 2

<p>I know there some problems in code and system itself is pretty &quot;stupid&quot;, but the main problem now is that nonlinear MPC cannot get variable-size signal (MATLAB says that it is variable-size, but actually size is always the same, because I define number of points in this line <code>t = linspace(0,1,80);</code>). Simulink shows following errors.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/srya7.png"" alt=""errors in Simulink"" /></p>
<p>I tried couple of things. I made variable <code>bezierPoints</code> persistent, I tried other method of building Bezier curve from here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37642168/how-to-convert-quadratic-bezier-curve-code-into-cubic-bezier-curve/37642695#37642695"">How to convert quadratic bezier curve code into cubic bezier curve?</a>. In code above I used method from here: <a href=""https://blogs.mathworks.com/images/graphics/bezierpost.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bézier Curves and Kronecker's Tensor Product</a>. I moved assignment of variable <code>bezierPoints</code> to the end of the function (I thought that maybe multiple assignments make this error occur because of somehow different vector sizes). But nothing worked.</p>
<p>So now I relate this problem to the method that I use for building Bezier curve. Is there any method to build this curve during simulation as fixed-size array? Before this function I predefined the curve before simulation and used block &quot;From Workspace&quot; with time reference for simulation, but now I need to build it during simulation depending on positions and velocities of both cars.</p>

<p>One constraint of this problem is, <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> should be integer multiples of <code>0.0625</code>. Despite getting superior result, my algorithm doesn't satisfy this constraint. I have provided the objective function and function for constraints in my MATLAB code.

<p>The reason I want to do this is a bit complex but for short I have a matlab class storing data in one projection mode, but I still want to be able to access data in other various projection modes (mainly for display purpose). I thus have dependent properties which make on the fly conversion on stored data.</p>
<p>So far, so good, the problem is that for some data coordinates (accumulation points) going from one projection mode to another is ambiguous unless I know on which cut (i.e. which subscript) I am ... Being able to pre-detect one dimension is becoming scalar after the subscript I can be smart and check if I can rework computed value before returning it ... For instance this will avoids having artifacts when plotting data in 1D because in one cut you have to choose one formula and in the other cut another one.</p>
<p>Here is the solution I come up with by overloading <code>subsref</code> method and parsing the subscript description structure:</p>

            this.EEl = rand(n,m,k,l);
        end
    end

    % Really stored values in projection mode 1
    properties(Access=private)

        EEl;
    end

    % Projection in mode 2 computed on the fly

        EPhi;
    end
    methods

        % Generic formula
        function [ephi] = get.EPhi(this)
            ephi = (sqrt(2)/2)*(this.EAz + this.EEl); % This is dummy (real formula is more complex and depends on coordinates)
        end

        % Detection of special cuts
        function [varargout] = subsref(this, s)

<p>In the above, * is the convolution operator (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia link</a>).</p>

<p>The following Matlab program shows the difference between padding and not padding the matrices.  I suspect that not padding the matrices results in a circular convolution, <em>but I would like to perform a linear convolution without aliasing</em>.</p>

<p>If I do pad the two matrices, then how do I truncate the output of the convolution so that <strong>C</strong> is the same size as <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>?</p>

<pre><code>A = rgb2gray(im2double(imread('1.png'))); % input A
B = rgb2gray(im2double(imread('2.png'))); % kernel B

figure;
imagesc(A); colormap gray;
title ('A')

figure;
imagesc(B); colormap gray;
title ('B')

[m,n] = size(A);
mm = 2*m - 1;
nn = 2*n - 1;

C = (ifft2(fft2(A,mm,nn).* fft2(B,mm,nn)));

figure;
imagesc(C); colormap gray;
title ('C with padding')

C0 = (ifft2(fft2(A).* fft2(B)));

figure;

Furthermore the frequencies of &quot;fi&quot; in first column do not respect the input probabilities. With this code, the frequencies are respected, but in somehow you should change &quot;p&quot; for each ugt.</p>

You take the noise and run it through the filter which outputs an estimate of the noise occurring at the source signal. Which you in turn subtract from the signal with noise and the original signal, and doing so result in a filtered signal. I have tried using the built-in LMS function, but have had no luck.

I use the following code to downsample the chrominance of an image for the first step of jpeg compression.</p>
<pre><code>resampler = vision.ChromaResampler;
[Cb, Cr] = resampler(Cb_channel, Cr_channel);
</code></pre>
<p>the function is part of the computer vision toolbox for matlab.</p>
<p>for example before downsampling:</p>
<p>Y dimensions = 3024 by 4032;
Cb and Cr dimensions = 3024 by 4032</p>
<p>after downsampling:</p>
<p>Y dimensions = 3024 by 4032;
Cb and Cr dimensions = 3024 by 2016</p>
<p>to display the original RGB image after decompression, the dimensions of all 3 Y, Cb and Cr components need to be the same so that I can merge the channels and convert the image back to RGB. I'm using the following code to achieve this:</p>
<pre><code>Cb_resized = imresize(Cb, [(size(Cb, 1)) (2*size(Cb, 2))]);
Cr_resized = imresize(Cr, [(size(Cr, 1)) (2*size(Cr, 2))]);
</code></pre>
<p>When I then merge the 3 channels and use imshow() to see the image it looks fine. So is the above method the correct way of reversing the downsampled chrominance when decoding a jpeg?</p>

From this table I would like to merge records/rows with connection stop_ and start_dates and show the result in a new worksheet. A simplified version of the data is shown below.</p>

<pre><code>Customer_id subscription_id   start_date    stop_date
1034        RV4               30-4-2012     30-1-2015
1035        AB7               30-1-2014     30-3-2014
1035        AB6               30-1-2014     30-3-2014
1035        AB7               30-12-2013    30-1-2014
1035        AB7               12-12-2012    30-12-2013
1035        AB7               12-9-2010     14-1-2011
</code></pre>

<p>So, the formula has to check the customer_id and the subscription_id. When there is a match between two or more rows in the sheet and the stop_date of one of the rows overlaps with the start_date of the other row, then after the extraction and merging, one new row must be shown with the start_date of the first and the stop_date of the other row. This also has to work if there are multiple rows with connecting dates. All the rows that don't match these criteria stay the same after the extraction. So the result will be like this:</p>

<pre><code>Customer_id subscription_id start_date  stop_date
1034        RV4             30-4-2012   30-1-2015
1035        AB6             30-1-2014   30-3-2014
1035        AB7             12-12-2012  30-3-2014
1035        AB7             12-9-2010   14-1-2011
</code></pre>

<p>A dynamic solution would be ideal while new data will be added to the original sheet. While I know this is possible when you're certain that the rows you're looking for are always below each other, this is not the case here and it wouldn't give you a very dynamic solution.  </p>

<p>So some kind of array function would be needed in Excel I guess but after searching a lot I couldn't find a suitable solution. I've also got MATLAB available but no clue where to start in that program with a problem like this.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>By looking at the sympy library, I made a simple solution with it. I am sharing it, but I would like to keep that question open for a solution without sympy. Maybe using numpy arrays instead of variables, or if there is a way to create a lambda function by unpacking a n number of arguments. Something equivalent to the unpacking in <code>lambdify([x, *list_of_params], equation, 'numpy')</code> but without sympy.</p>

<pre><code>classdef MyData &lt; handle
    properties
        p;
    end
    methods
        function obj = MyData(p)
            obj.p = p;
        end
        function sref = subsref(obj, s)
            if (length(s) == 1) &amp;&amp; strcmp(s.type, '()') &amp;&amp; (length(s.subs) == 1)
                % here, the real data are 'somehow' computed
                sref = s.subs{1}*obj.p;
            end
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>I can access the data simply by:</p>
<pre><code>myData = MyData(5);
myData(3)
ans = 
    15
</code></pre>
<p>Since I do almost have a vector-like behaviour, I was interested if I can actually push it even further to use native matlab functions that works on numerical arrays like <code>sum()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, etc. Sure, I would have to owerload some other methods like <code>size</code>, <code>numel</code>, <code>end</code> and who knows what else, but it does not seem enough.</p>
<p>Since the arguments of mentioned functions must be either numeric or logical, it looks like I would have to subclass some build-in type like <code>double</code> for instance, probably something like this:</p>
<pre><code>classdef MyData &lt; double
    properties
        p;
    end
    methods
        function obj = MyData(p)
            obj@double(...); % here is the problem
            obj.p = p;
        end
        function sref = subsref(obj, s)
            if (length(s) == 1) &amp;&amp; strcmp(s.type, '()') &amp;&amp; (length(s.subs) == 1)
                % here the real data are 'somehow' computed
                sref = s.subs{1}*obj.p;
            end
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>However, the problem I have is that I need to call the constructor of the <code>double</code> class with the actuall data that I do not have. And I can not fill this values because the data are quite large. The whole point here is that the data would be accessed uppon request once they are actually needed and droped right away. The more I think about it it looks like it can not be done, but maybe somebody knows how to pull it off...</p>

<p>The lure(s) that appears with each target(s) should not always be the same. I want the lure that is shown with the target to be randomly selected in each trial (as can be seen in the trials image there is more than one possible lure). In the trials image I have attached the trial numbers are presented just for clarity, in each block the presentation of the targets needs to be randomized.</p>

In a nutshell it is composed by a succession of straights and circles (tangents to the straights between which they are included). My data set is composed by survey points, measured along the railway with an uncertainty. My goal is to approximate this data set with a succession of straights and tangent circles (with the center on the bisector of the two straights in which it's included), such that certain constraints are respected (the most important concerns deviations, so i have to set lower and upper bounds).
I'm developing an algorithm that recognize (or try to) if the survey points belong to a straight or a circle (simply, computing the change rate of gradient). After having cataloged all the points in the single lines and circles (I have the point group that belongs to the first straight, the point group that belongs to the second straights and the point group that belongs to the first circle, tangent to the first to straights.... and so on...). So, I need to approximate all the point group that belongs to tangents with a continuous piecewise linear function, respecting lower and upper bounds constraints.</p>
<p>Could someone help me to implement in Matlab this continuous piecewise linear approximation, or maybe with some alternative ideas?</p>

My intention is to capture every possible transition from one action to another using the shortest sequence possible. Say that there are <code>N</code> possible actions, I am searching for an algorithm that can generate a set of random sequences with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding through each sequence, consecutive two elements represents a transition from one action to another. Therefore, except for the start and end of the sequence, every element will serve as the end of one transition and also the start of the next transition. From what I observe using small examples, this approach appears to produce the shortest sequence while covering all transitions.</li>
<li>Code implementing the algorithm must return all such valid shortest sequences.</li>
<li>Cannot have two consecutive elements be the same (i.e. self transitions are not allowed).</li>
<li>Must use basic functions available in Python and MATLAB, so I cannot use modules/libraries that maybe available in Python but not in MATLAB (or vice-versa).</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, say I have 3 actions: <code>{A, B, C}</code>. One of the expected sequences this algorithm should produce is: <code>ABCBACA</code>. Sliding through this sequence, taking 2 elements at a time, I get <code>{AB, BC, CB, BA, AC, CA}</code>. As expected, this covers all 6 transitions that is possible using a sequence of length 7. The sequence has no two consecutive elements that are the same. Another valid sequence that this algorithm might produce is: <code>ACABCBA</code>. Sliding through this sequence taking 2 elements at a time, I get <code>{AC, CA, AB, BC, CB, BA}</code>, thus covering all transitions, with no two consecutive elements being the same.</p>
<p>I worked out both examples using a pen and paper, but I am having trouble seeing a pattern, particularly for <code>N &gt;3</code>. How do I proceed from here?</p>
<p>It appears that a sequence of length <code>N*(N-1) + 1</code> would be the shortest sequence in my case, which I think makes sense. I also observed that the start and end of such sequences are the same (i.e. if we start at <code>A</code>, we end at <code>A</code>). It almost appears as if this is a circular list instead of a linear list. Is this generally true?</p>

<p>As to the expected output. We'd want,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>beta(z+1,i) + TAU(z+1,i) = exp(beta(z,i) + TAU(z,i+1))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we want to grow i to a fixed value n. Again, I haven't programmed in forever, so I apologize if I'm speaking a little nonsensically.</p>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<p>So, as @rahnema1 suggests; I should produce a reproducible example. In order to do this, I'll write the code for my beta function. It's surprisingly simple. This is for the case where the &quot;multiplier&quot; variable is set to log(2); but you don't need to worry about any of that.</p>
<pre><code>function f = beta(z,n)
    f=0;
    for i = 0:n-1
        f = exp(f)/(1+exp(log(2)*(n-i-z)));
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This will work fine for z a float no greater than 4. Once you make z larger it'll start to overflow. So for example, if you put in,</p>
<pre><code>beta(2,100)

 1.4242

beta(3,100)

 3.3235

beta(3,100) - exp(beta(2,100))/(1/4+1)

0
</code></pre>
<p>The significance of the 100, is simply how many iterations we perform; it converges fast so even setting this to 15 or so will still produce the same numerical accuracy. Now, the expected output I want for TAU is pretty straight forward,</p>
<pre><code>TAU(z,1) = log(beta(z+1,1)) - beta(z,1)
TAU(z,2) = log(beta(z+1,2) + TAU(z+1,1)) - beta(z,2)
TAU(z,3) = log(beta(z+1,3) + TAU(z+1,2)) - beta(z,3)
...
TAU(z,n) = log(beta(z+1,n) + TAU(z+1,n-1)) -beta(z,n)
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this helps. I feel like there should be an easy way to program this sequence, and I must be missing something obvious; but maybe it's just not possible in Matlab.</p>
<p>At mimocha's suggestion, I'll look into tail-end recursion. I hope to god I don't have to go back to Pari-gp; but it looks like I may have to. Not looking forward to doing a deep dive on that language, lol.</p>

<p>I think Simulink thinks this variable as a scalar and does not acccept a vector definition in Model Explorer (1 x 1514). Does anyone knows how to make sure that a variable is defined as a vector, or am I doing something wrong because this variable makes problem for the last 2 days.</p>

<p>It works for <code>compoundLength = 2</code> as per the defaults in that file, but for <code>compoundLength = 3+</code> it will only reduce risk on the last trade.</p>
<p>In there I am trying to program the <code>calcRisk()</code> function to replace the logic in lines 56 and 51 such that the partial preservation of previous returns is spread across the series (not including the first trade) rather than only occurring on the last trade.</p>
<p><em>The original problem was:</em> with a reward:risk ratio of 3, by adding the return on the first trade to the 1% of the new account value as the risk for the second trade (so as to increase upside potential whilst not losing more than the initial 1% across the 2 trades), how do I limit the risk placed on the second trade to that neccessary to hit the target of 10.1%?</p>
<p>This is achieved in a series of 2 by the logic at line 56 and preserves around 50% (depending on previous drawdown) of the returns from trade 1.</p>
<p>The object is to extend this to n (<code>compoundLength</code>) trades. The monte-carlo simulator runs 1,000,000 possible trade series, calculating the reduced cumulative risk on the next trade after every profitable trade, but on series of 3+, as it stands, all the benefit of the reduced risk is only realised on the last trade.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqKCM.jpg"" alt=""The cover image of The Scope Issue 134""></p>

<p>Given an JPEG image (as seen above), what's the best way to read it in, parse it into some data structure and solve the maze? My first instinct is to read the image in pixel by pixel and store it in a list (array) of boolean values: <code>True</code> for a white pixel, and <code>False</code> for a non-white pixel (the colours can be discarded). The issue with this method, is that the image may not be ""pixel perfect"". By that I simply mean that if there is a white pixel somewhere on a wall it may create an unintended path.</p>

<p>Another method (which came to me after a bit of thought) is to convert the image to an SVG file - which is a list of paths drawn on a canvas. This way, the paths could be read into the same sort of list (boolean values) where <code>True</code> indicates a path or wall, <code>False</code> indicating a travel-able space. An issue with this method arises if the conversion is not 100% accurate, and does not fully connect all of the walls, creating gaps.</p>

<p>Also an issue with converting to SVG is that the lines are not ""perfectly"" straight. This results in the paths being cubic bezier curves. With a list (array) of boolean values indexed by integers, the curves would not transfer easily, and all the points that line on the curve would have to be calculated, but won't exactly match to list indices.</p>

<p>I assume that while one of these methods may work (though probably not) that they are woefully inefficient given such a large image, and that there exists a better way. How is this best (most efficiently and/or with the least complexity) done? Is there even a best way?</p>

<p>Then comes the solving of the maze. If I use either of the first two methods, I will essentially end up with a matrix. According to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3097677/1267663"">this answer</a>, a good way to represent a maze is using a tree, and a good way to solve it is using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2a_search_algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">A* algorithm</a>. How would one create a tree from the image? Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>
Best way to parse? Into what data structure? How would said structure help/hinder solving?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
I've tried my hand at implementing what @Mikhail has written in Python, using <code>numpy</code>, as @Thomas recommended. I feel that the algorithm is correct, but it's not working as hoped.

of <code>strcat( a b )</code>, <code>strcmp( a, b )</code>, retrieve first element of <code>strfind( a, b )</code>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The problem: slowdown</strong></p>
<p>I put the above things to use and immediately noticed a <em>drastic</em> slowdown. Am I doing it wrong (which is certainly possible as I have rather limited MATLAB experience), or does MATLAB's OOP just introduce a lot of overhead?</p>
<p><strong>My test case</strong></p>
<p>Here's the simple test I did for string, basically just appending a string and removing the appended part again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Don't actually write a String class like this in real code! Matlab has a native <code>string</code> array type now, and you should use that instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>classdef String &lt; handle
  ....
  properties
    stringobj = '';
  end
  function o = plus( o, b )
    o.stringobj = [ o.stringobj b ];
  end
  function n = Length( o )
    n = length( o.stringobj );
  end
  function o = SetLength( o, n )
    o.stringobj = o.stringobj( 1 : n );
  end
end

function atest( a, b ) %plain functions
  n = length( a );
  a = [ a b ];
  a = a( 1 : n );

function btest( a, b ) %OOP
  n = a.Length();
  a = a + b;
  a.SetLength( n );

function RunProfilerLoop( nLoop, fun, varargin )
  profile on;
  for i = 1 : nLoop
    fun( varargin{ : } );
  end
  profile off;
  profile report;

a = 'test';
aString = String( 'test' );
RunProfilerLoop( 1000, @(x,y)atest(x,y), a, 'appendme' );
RunProfilerLoop( 1000, @(x,y)btest(x,y), aString, 'appendme' );
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The results</strong></p>
<p>Total time in seconds, for 1000 iterations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>btest 0.550 (with String.SetLength 0.138, String.plus 0.065, String.Length 0.057)</p>
<p>atest 0.015</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Results for the logger system are likewise: 0.1 seconds for 1000 calls
to <code>frpintf( 1, 'test\n' )</code>, 7 (!) seconds for 1000 calls to my system when using the String class internally (OK, it has a lot more logic in it, but to compare with C++: the overhead of my system that uses <code>std::string( &quot;blah&quot; )</code> and <code>std::cout</code> at the output side vs plain <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;blah&quot;</code> is on the order of 1 millisecond.)</p>
<p><strong>Is it just overhead when looking up class/package functions?</strong></p>
<p>Since MATLAB is interpreted, it has to look up the definition of a function/object at run time. So I was wondering that maybe much more overhead is involved in looking up class or package function vs functions that are in the path. I tried to test this, and it just gets stranger. To rule out the influence of classes/objects, I compared calling a function in the path vs a function in a package:</p>
<pre><code>function n = atest( x, y )
  n = ctest( x, y ); % ctest is in matlab path

function n = btest( x, y )
  n = util.ctest( x, y ); % ctest is in +util directory, parent directory is in path
</code></pre>
<p>Results, gathered same way as above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>atest 0.004 sec, 0.001 sec in ctest</p>
<p>btest 0.060 sec, 0.014 sec in util.ctest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, is all this overhead just coming from MATLAB spending time looking up definitions for its OOP implementation, whereas this overhead is not there for functions that are directly in the path?</p>

<p>On my machine (Matlab 2011b on Linux Mint 12), the output of this test is:</p>

<pre><code>Elapsed time is 1.020689 seconds.
Elapsed time is 9.248388 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>What the?!? <code>arrayfun</code>, while admittedly a cleaner looking solution, is an order of magnitude slower. What is going on here?</p>

<p>Further, I did a similar style of test for <code>cellfun</code> and found it to be about 3 times slower than an explicit loop. Again, this result is the opposite of what I expected.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Why are <code>arrayfun</code> and <code>cellfun</code> so much slower? And given this, are there any good reasons to use them (other than to make the code look good)?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm talking about the standard version of <code>arrayfun</code> here, NOT the GPU version from the parallel processing toolbox.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just to be clear, I'm aware that <code>Func1</code> above can be vectorized as pointed out by Oli. I only chose it because it yields a simple speed test for the purposes of the actual question.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Following the suggestion of grungetta, I re-did the test with <code>feature accel off</code>. The results are:</p>

<pre><code>Elapsed time is 28.183422 seconds.
Elapsed time is 23.525251 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it would appear that a big part of the difference is that the JIT accelerator does a much better job of speeding up the explicit <code>for</code> loop than it does <code>arrayfun</code>. This seems odd to me, since <code>arrayfun</code> actually provides more information, ie, its use reveals that the order of the calls to <code>Func1</code> do not matter. Also, I noted that whether the JIT accelerator is switched on or off, my system only ever uses one CPU...</p>

<hr>

<h2>Some background</h2>

<p>I am working on a problem in Matlab that requires a scale-space representation of an image. To do this I create a 2-D Gaussian filter with variance <code>sigma*s^k</code> for <code>k</code> in some range., and then I use each one in turn to filter the image.  Now, I want some sort of mapping from <code>k</code> to the filtered image.</p>

<p>If <code>k</code> were always an integer, I'd simply create a 3D array such that:</p>

<pre><code>arr[k] = &lt;image filtered with k-th guassian&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, <code>k</code> is not necessarily an integer, so I can't do this.  What I thought of doing was keeping an array of <code>k</code>s such that:</p>

<pre><code>arr[find(array_of_ks_ = k)] = &lt;image filtered with k-th guassian&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems pretty good at first thought, except I will be doing this lookup potentially a few thousand times with about 20 or 30 values of <code>k</code>, and I fear that this will hurt performance.  </p>

<p>I wonder if I wouldn't be better served doing this with a hash table of some sort so that I would have a lookup time that is O(1) instead of O(n).</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, I know that I shouldn't optimize prematurely, and I may not have this problem at all, but remember, this is just the background, and there may be cases where this is really the best solution, regardless of whether it is the best solution for <em>my</em> problem.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the slide is ""source: Sam Roweis, Yair Weiss, Eero Simoncelli"" and at the bottom of an earlier slide is ""Audio clips courtesy of Te-Won Lee"". In the video, Professor Ng says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""So you might look at unsupervised learning like this and ask, 'How complicated is it to implement this?' It seems like in order to build this application, it seems like to do this audio processing, you would write a ton of code, or maybe link  into a bunch of C++ or Java libraries that process audio. It seems like it would be a really complicated program to do this audio: separating out audio and so on. It turns out the algorithm to do what you just heard, that can be done with just one line of code ... shown right here. It did take researchers a long time to come up with this line of code. So I'm not saying this is an easy problem. But it turns out that when you use the right programming environment many learning algorithms will be really short programs.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The separated audio results played in the video lecture are not perfect but, in my opinion, amazing. Does anyone have any insight on how that one line of code performs so well? In particular, does anyone know of a reference that explains the work of Te-Won Lee, Sam Roweis, Yair Weiss, and Eero Simoncelli with respect to that one line of code?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>To demonstrate the algorithm's sensitivity to microphone separation distance, the following simulation (in Octave) separates the tones from two spatially separated tone generators.</p>

<pre><code>% define model 
f1 = 1100;              % frequency of tone generator 1; unit: Hz 
f2 = 2900;              % frequency of tone generator 2; unit: Hz

dSrc = 10;              % distance between tone generators centered about origin; unit: m 
c = 340.29;             % speed of sound; unit: m / s 

% generate tones
figure(1);
t = [0:Ts:0.025];
tone1 = sin(2*pi*f1*t);
tone2 = sin(2*pi*f2*t);
plot(t,tone1); 
hold on;
plot(t,tone2,'r'); xlabel('time'); ylabel('amplitude'); axis([0 0.005 -1 1]); legend('tone 1', 'tone 2');

<p>After about 10 minutes of execution on my laptop computer, the simulation generates the following three figures illustrating the two isolated tones have the correct frequencies.</p>

<p>However, setting the microphone separation distance to zero (i.e., dMic = 0) causes the simulation to instead generate the following three figures illustrating the simulation could not isolate a second tone (confirmed by the single significant diagonal term returned in svd's s matrix).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9QbR.png"" alt=""Figure 1 with no mic separation"">

<p>I was hoping the microphone separation distance on a smartphone would be large enough to produce good results but setting the microphone separation distance to 5.25 inches (i.e., dMic = 0.1333 meters) causes the simulation to generate the following, less than encouraging, figures illustrating higher frequency components in the first isolated tone.</p>

<p>I always understood MATLAB variables to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format"" rel=""noreferrer"">double-precision</a> by default. So, if I were to do something like declare a variable with 20 digits after the decimal point:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; num = 2.71828182845904553488;
&gt;&gt; class(num)  % Display the variable type
ans =
double
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect the last 4 digits to be ignored, since the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eps.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">floating-point relative accuracy</a> is on the order of 10<sup>-16</sup>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; eps(num)
ans =
    4.440892098500626e-016
</code></pre>

<p>If I try to display the number with more than 16 digits after the decimal point (using either <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fprintf</code></a> or <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sprintf.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>sprintf</code></a>), I get what I expect to see:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; fprintf('%0.20f\n', num)
2.71828182845904550000
&gt;&gt; sprintf('%0.20f', num)
ans =
2.71828182845904550000
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, digits 17 through 20 are all 0.</p>

<p>But things get weird when I pass <code>num</code> to the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/vpa.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">variable precision arithmetic function</a> in the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Symbolic Toolbox</a>, telling it to represent the number using 21 digits of precision:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; vpa(num, 21)
ans =
2.71828182845904553488
</code></pre>

<p><strong>WHAT?!</strong> Those last 4 digits have reappeared! Shouldn't they have been lost when the original number I entered was stored as a double-precision variable <code>num</code>? Since <code>num</code> is a double-precision variable when it is passed to <code>vpa</code>, how did <code>vpa</code> know what they were?</p>

<p>My best guess as to what is happening is that MATLAB internally represents <code>num</code> with more precision than a double since I initialized it to a number with more digits past the decimal point than a double-precision variable could handle. Is this really what is happening, or is something else going on?</p>

<pre><code>[points(:,1), points(:,2)] = intersections(...

&gt;&gt; vertex2    
vertex2 =

<p>Two points (<code>vertex1</code> and <code>vertex2</code>) should be eliminated from the result. It should be done by the below commands:</p>

points = points((points(:,1) ~= vertex2(1)) | (points(:,2) ~= vertex2(2)), :);

<p>After doing that, we have this unexpected outcome:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; points
points =

</code></pre>

<p>The outcome should be an empty matrix. As you can see, the first (or second?) pair of <code>[33.0000 24.0000]</code> has been eliminated, but not the second one.</p>

<p>Then I checked these two expressions:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; points(1) ~= vertex2(1)
ans =
     0
&gt;&gt; points(2) ~= vertex2(2)
ans =
     1   % &lt;-- It means 24.0000 is not equal to 24.0000?

<hr>

<p>More surprisingly, I made a new script that has only these commands:</p>

<pre><code>points = [12.0000   15.0000

(Matlab),"<p>I've stumbled upon the weird way (in my view) that Matlab is dealing with <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/empty-matrices-scalars-and-vectors.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">empty matrices</a>. For example, if two empty matrices are multiplied the result is:</p>

<pre><code>zeros(3,0)*zeros(0,3)
ans =

 0     0     0
 0     0     0
 0     0     0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this already took me by surprise, however, a quick search got me to the link above, and I got an explanation of the somewhat twisted logic of why this is happening. </p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, nothing prepared me for the following observation. I asked myself, how efficient is this type of multiplication vs just using <code>zeros(n)</code> function, say for the purpose of initialization?  I've used <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18798"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>timeit</code></a> to answer this:</p>

<pre><code>f=@() zeros(1000)
timeit(f)
ans =
    0.0033

<p>vs:</p>

<pre><code>g=@() zeros(1000,0)*zeros(0,1000)
timeit(g)
ans =
    9.2048e-06
</code></pre>

<p>Both have the same outcome of 1000x1000 matrix of zeros of class <code>double</code>, but the empty matrix multiplication one is ~350 times faster! (a similar result happens using <code>tic</code> and <code>toc</code> and a loop)</p>

<p>How can this be? are <code>timeit</code> or <code>tic,toc</code> bluffing or have I found a faster way to initialize matrices? 
(this was done with matlab 2012a, on a win7-64 machine,  intel-i5 650 3.2Ghz...)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>After reading your feedback, I have looked more carefully into this peculiarity, and tested on 2 different computers (same matlab ver though 2012a) a code that examine the run time vs the size of matrix n. This is what I get:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSZn7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The code to generate this used <code>timeit</code> as before, but a loop with <code>tic</code> and <code>toc</code> will look the same. So, for small sizes, <code>zeros(n)</code> is comparable. However, around <code>n=400</code> there is a jump in performance for the empty matrix multiplication. The code I've used to generate that plot was:</p>

<pre><code>n=unique(round(logspace(0,4,200)));
for k=1:length(n)
    f=@() zeros(n(k));
    t1(k)=timeit(f);

    g=@() zeros(n(k),0)*zeros(0,n(k));
    t2(k)=timeit(g);
end

loglog(n,t1,'b',n,t2,'r');
legend('zeros(n)','zeros(n,0)*zeros(0,n)',2);
xlabel('matrix size (n)'); ylabel('time [sec]');
</code></pre>

<p>Are any of you experience this too?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #2:</strong></p>

<p>Incidentally, empty matrix multiplication is not needed to get this effect. One can simply do:</p>

<pre><code>z(n,n)=0;
</code></pre>

<p>where n> some threshold matrix size seen in the previous graph,  and get the <strong>exact</strong> efficiency profile as with empty matrix multiplication (again using timeit). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZVOI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here's an example where it improves efficiency of a code:</p>

<pre><code>n = 1e4;
clear z1
tic
z1 = zeros( n ); 
for cc = 1 : n
    z1(:,cc)=cc;
end
toc % Elapsed time is 0.445780 seconds.

%%
clear z0
tic
z0 = zeros(n,0)*zeros(0,n);
for cc = 1 : n
    z0(:,cc)=cc;
end
toc % Elapsed time is 0.297953 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>However, using <code>z(n,n)=0;</code> instead yields similar results to the <code>zeros(n)</code> case.</p>

<p>My question is motivated by simple observations, which somewhat undermine the beliefs/assumptions often held/made by experienced MATLAB users:</p>

<ul>
<li>MATLAB is very well optimized when it comes to the built-in functions and the fundamental language features, such as indexing vectors and matrices.</li>
<li>Loops in MATLAB are slow (despite the JIT) and should generally be avoided if the algorithm can be expressed in a native, 'vectorized' manner. </li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line: core MATLAB functionality is efficient and trying to outperform it using MATLAB code is hard, if not impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Investigating performance of vector indexing</strong></p>

<p>The example codes shown below are as fundamental as it gets: I assign a scalar value to all vector entries. First, I allocate an empty vector <code>x</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tic; x = zeros(1e8,1); toc
Elapsed time is 0.260525 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Having <code>x</code> I would like to set all its entries to the same value. In practice you would do it differently, e.g., <code>x = value*ones(1e8,1)</code>, but the point here is to investigate the performance of vector indexing. The simplest way is to write:</p>

<pre><code>tic; x(:) = 1; toc
Elapsed time is 0.094316 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Let's call it method 1 (from the value assigned to <code>x</code>). It seems to be very fast (faster at least than memory allocation). Because the only thing I do here is operate on memory, I can estimate the efficiency of this code by calculating the obtained <em>effective memory bandwidth</em> and comparing it to the <em>hardware memory bandwidth</em> of my computer:</p>

<pre><code>eff_bandwidth = numel(x) * 8 bytes per double * 2 / time
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, I multiply by <code>2</code> because unless SSE streaming is used, setting values in memory requires that the vector is both read from and written to the memory. In the above example:</p>

<pre><code>eff_bandwidth(1) = 1e8*8*2/0.094316 = 17 Gb/s
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/"" rel=""noreferrer"">STREAM-benchmarked memory bandwidth</a> of my computer is around 17.9 Gb/s, so indeed - MATLAB delivers close to peak performance in this case! So far, so good.</p>

<p>Method 1 is suitable if you want to set <em>all</em> vector elements to some value. But if you want to access elements every <code>step</code> entries, you need to substitute the <code>:</code> with e.g., <code>1:step:end</code>. Below is a direct speed comparison with method 1:</p>

<pre><code>tic; x(1:end) = 2; toc
Elapsed time is 0.496476 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>While you would not expect it to perform any different, method 2 is clearly big trouble: factor 5 slowdown for no reason. My suspicion is that in this case MATLAB explicitly allocates the index vector (<code>1:end</code>). This is somewhat confirmed by using explicit vector size instead of <code>end</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tic; x(1:1e8) = 3; toc
Elapsed time is 0.482083 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Methods 2 and 3 perform equally bad.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to explicitly create an index vector <code>id</code> and use it to index <code>x</code>. This gives you the most flexible indexing capabilities. In our case:</p>

<pre><code>tic;
id = 1:1e8; % colon(1,1e8);
x(id) = 4;
toc
Elapsed time is 1.208419 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Now that is really something - 12 times slowdown compared to method 1! I understand it should perform worse than method 1 because of the additional memory used for <code>id</code>, but why is it so much worse than methods 2 and 3?</p>

<p>Let's try to give the loops a try - as hopeless as it may sound.</p>

<pre><code>tic;
for i=1:numel(x)
    x(i) = 5;
end
toc
Elapsed time is 0.788944 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>A big surprise - a loop beats a <code>vectorized</code> method 4, but is still slower than methods 1, 2 and 3. It turns out that in this particular case you can do it better:</p>

<pre><code>tic;
for i=1:1e8
    x(i) = 6;
end
toc
Elapsed time is 0.321246 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>And that is the probably the most bizarre outcome of this study - <strong>a MATLAB-written loop significantly outperforms native vector indexing</strong>. That should certainly not be so. Note that the JIT'ed loop is still 3 times slower than the theoretical peak almost obtained by method 1. So there is still plenty of room for improvement. It is just surprising (a stronger word would be more suitable) that usual 'vectorized' indexing (<code>1:end</code>) is even slower.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is simple indexing in MATLAB <strong>very</strong> inefficient (methods 2, 3, and 4 are slower than method 1), or did I miss something?</li>
<li>why is method 4 <strong>(so much) slower</strong> than methods 2 and 3?</li>
<li>why does using <code>1e8</code> instead of <code>numel(x)</code> as a loop bound speed up the code by factor 2?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
After reading Jonas's comment, here is another way to do that using logical indices:</p>

<pre><code>tic;
id = logical(ones(1, 1e8));
x(id) = 7;
toc
Elapsed time is 0.613363 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Much better than method 4.</p>

<p>For convenience:</p>

<pre><code>function test

tic; x = zeros(1,1e8); toc

tic; x(:) = 1; toc
tic; x(1:end) = 2; toc
tic; x(1:1e8) = 3; toc

tic;
id = 1:1e8; % colon(1,1e8);
x(id) = 4;
toc

tic;
for i=1:numel(x)
    x(i) = 5;
end
toc

tic;
for i=1:1e8
    x(i) = 6;
end
toc

end

But I guess there is pretty much more than that, which is also evident from the practice.</p>

<p>When I do simple calculations like montecarlo averaging of a Gaussian sample collection or so, I see there is not much of a difference between a C++ implementation or MATLAB implementation, sometimes in fact MATLAB performs a bit better in time.</p>

<p>When I move on to larger scale simulations with thousands of lines of code, slowly the real picture shows up. C++ simulations show superior performance like 100x better in time complexity than an equivalent MATLAB implementation.</p>

<p>The code in C++ most of the times, is pretty much serial and no hi-fi optimization is done explicitly. Whereas, as per my awareness, MATLAB inherently does a lot of optimization. This shows up for example when I try to generate a huge chunk of random samples, where as the equivalent in C++ using some library like IT++/GSL/Boost performs relatively slower (the algorithm used is the same namely mt19937).</p>

<p><strong>My question is simply to know if there is a simpler tradeoff between MATLAB/C++ in performance. Is it just like what people say, ""Whenever you can, C/C++ is the better""(The frequently experienced)?. In a different perspective, ""What is MATLAB good for, other than comfort?""</strong></p>

<p>By the way, I don't see coding efficiency parameter being significant here, thinking of the same programmer in both cases.  And also, I think the other alternatives like python,R are not relevant here. But dependence on the specific libraries we use should be interesting.</p>

This question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3534867/why-when-should-i-prefer-matlab-over-octave"">Why/when should I prefer MATLAB over Octave?</a>) answered several, but there is still one lingering...</p>

<p>I've read a number of posts/other sources comparing performance of Octave and MATLAB, and I've run some of my own tests on standard scripts that confirm the general consensus that Octave is generally much slower than MATLAB for standard operations (iterated, of course, so that the comparison is meaningful).</p>

<p>The consensus also seems to suggest that most of MATLAB's performance boost is attributable to its JIT compiler, which compiles large loops at runtime. This makes sense, and the largest performance differences appear to occur in these cases (e.g <a href=""http://thatcadguy.blogspot.fr/2011/01/mathworks-matlab-vs-gnu-octave.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mathworks Matlab vs Gnu Octave</a>)</p>

<p>My question is the following: why should it be the case that vectorized code also runs more slowly in Octave? It seems that in this case memory should be set aside before the loop and some native C/C++ loop should perform the operation, which would equate performance between Octave and MATLAB for vectorized code. Additionally, does this have broader implications, i.e. that Octave might perform more poorly for complex operations, even if code is written such that a JIT compiler is unneeded/unused?</p>

<p>There seem to be plenty of examples showing how to sample from a uniform spherical shell, but that seems to be easier an easier problem.

<h1>Question Preamble</h1>

<p>I have taken an image with a fisheye lens.  This image consists of a pattern with a bunch of square objects.  What I want to do with this image is detect the centroid of each of these squares, then use these points to perform an undistortion of the image - specifically, I am seeking the right distortion model parameters.  It should be noted that not all of the squares need to be detected.  As long as a good majority of them are, then that's totally fine.... but that isn't the point of this post.  The parameter estimation algorithm I have already written, but the problem is that it requires points that appear collinear in the image.  </p>

<p>The base question I want to ask is given these points, what is the best way to group them together so that each group consists of a horizontal line or vertical line?</p>

<h1>Background to my problem</h1>

<p>This isn't really important with regards to the question I'm asking, but if you'd like to know where I got my data from and to further understand the question I'm asking, please read.  If you're not interested, then you can skip right to the <strong>Problem setup</strong> section below.</p>

<hr>

<p>An example of an image I am dealing with is shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0RqUd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It is a 960 x 960 image.  The image was originally higher resolution, but I subsample the image to facilitate faster processing time.  As you can see, there are a bunch of square patterns that are dispersed in the image.  Also, the centroids I have calculated are with respect to the above subsampled image.</p>

<p>The pipeline I have set up to retrieve the centroids is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Perform a Canny Edge Detection</li>
<li>Focus on a region of interest that minimizes false positives.  This region of interest is basically the squares without any of the black tape that covers one of their sides.</li>
<li>Find all distinct closed contours</li>
<li><p>For each distinct closed contour...</p>

<p>a.  Perform a Harris Corner Detection</p>

<p>b.  Determine if the result has 4 corner points</p>

<p>c.  If this does, then this contour belonged to a square and find the centroid of this shape</p>

<p>d.  If it doesn't, then skip this shape</p></li>
<li><p>Place all detected centroids from Step #4 into a matrix for further examination.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example result with the above image.  Each detected square has the four points colour coded according to the location of where it is with respect to the square itself.  For each centroid that I have detected, I write an ID right where that centroid is in the image itself.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jz6LT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>With the above image, there are 37 detected squares.</p>

<h1>Problem Setup</h1>

<p>Suppose I have some image pixel points stored in a <code>N x 3</code> matrix.  The first two columns are the <code>x</code> (horizontal) and <code>y</code> (vertical) coordinates where in image coordinate space, the <code>y</code> coordinate is <strong>inverted</strong>, which means that positive <code>y</code> moves downwards.  The third column is an ID associated with the point.  </p>

<p>Here is some code written in MATLAB that takes these points, plots them onto a 2D grid and labels each point with the third column of the matrix. If you read the above background, these are the points that were detected by my algorithm outlined above.</p>

<p>For example, if you reference the image in the background section of my problem, we can see that there are 5 groups of points that can be grouped in a horizontal manner.  For example, points 23, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37 and 36 form one group.  Points 19, 21, 24, 28, 30 and 32 form another group and so on and so forth.  Similarly in a vertical sense, we can see that points 26, 19, 12 and 3 form one group, points 29, 21, 13 and 5 form another group and so on.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Question to ask</h1>

<p>My question is this:  <em>What is a method that can successfully group points in horizontal groupings and vertical groupings separately, given that the points could be in any orientation?</em></p>

<h2>Conditions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>There <strong>must be at least three</strong> points per line.  If there is anything less than that, then this does not qualify as a segment.  Therefore, the points 36 and 10 don't qualify as a vertical line, and similarly the isolated point 23 shouldn't quality as a vertical line, but it is part of the first horizontal grouping.</p></li>
<li><p>The above calibration pattern can be in any orientation.  However, for what I'm dealing with, the worst kind of orientation you can get is what you see above in the background section.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h1>Expected Output</h1>

<p>The output would be a pair of lists where the first list has elements where each element gives you a sequence of point IDs that form a horizontal line.  Similarly, the second list has elements where each element gives you a sequence of point IDs that form a vertical line.</p>

<p>Therefore, the expected output for the horizontal sequences would look something like this:</p>

<h2>MATLAB</h2>

<pre><code>horiz_list = {[23, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 36], [19, 21, 24, 28, 30, 32], ...};
vert_list = {[26, 19, 12, 3], [29, 21, 13, 5], ....};
</code></pre>

<h2>Python</h2>

<pre><code>horiz_list = [[23, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 36], [19, 21, 24, 28, 30, 32], ....]
vert_list = [[26, 19, 12, 3], [29, 21, 13, 5], ...]
</code></pre>

<h1>What I have tried</h1>

<p>Algorithmically, what I have tried is to undo the rotation that is experienced at these points.  I've performed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"" rel=""noreferrer"">Principal Components Analysis</a> and I tried projecting the points with respect to the computed orthogonal basis vectors so that the points would more or less be on a straight rectangular grid.  </p>

<p>Once I have that, it's just a simple matter of doing some scanline processing where you could group points based on a differential change on either the horizontal or vertical coordinates.  You'd sort the coordinates by either the <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> values, then examine these sorted coordinates and look for a large change.  Once you encounter this change, then you can group points in between the changes together to form your lines.  Doing this with respect to each dimension would give you either the horizontal or vertical groupings.</p>

<p>With regards to PCA, here's what I did in MATLAB and Python:</p>

<h2>MATLAB</h2>

<pre><code>%# Step #1 - Get just the data - no IDs
data_raw = data(:,1:2);

%# Decentralize mean
data_nomean = bsxfun(@minus, data_raw, mean(data_raw,1));

%# Step #2 - Determine covariance matrix
%# This already decentralizes the mean
cov_data = cov(data_raw);

%# Step #3 - Determine right singular vectors
[~,~,V] = svd(cov_data);

%# Step #4 - Transform data with respect to basis
F = V.'*data_nomean.';

%# Visualize both the original data points and transformed data
figure;
plot(F(1,:), F(2,:), 'b.', 'MarkerSize', 14);
axis ij;
hold on;
plot(data(:,1), data(:,2), 'r.', 'MarkerSize', 14);
</code></pre>

<h2>Python</h2>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import numpy.linalg as la

# Step #1 and Step #2 - Decentralize mean
centroids_raw = data[:,:2]
mean_data = np.mean(centroids_raw, axis=0)

# Transpose for covariance calculation
data_nomean = (centroids_raw - mean_data).T

# Step #3 - Determine covariance matrix
# Doesn't matter if you do this on the decentralized result
# or the normal result - cov subtracts the mean off anyway
cov_data = np.cov(data_nomean)

# Step #4 - Determine right singular vectors via SVD
# Note - This is already V^T, so there's no need to transpose
_,_,V = la.svd(cov_data)

# Step #5 - Transform data with respect to basis
data_transform = np.dot(V, data_nomean).T

plt.figure()
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()

plt.plot(data[:,0], data[:,1], 'b.', markersize=14)
plt.plot(data_transform[:,0], data_transform[:,1], 'r.', markersize=14)

plt.show()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The above code not only reprojects the data, but it also plots both the original points and the projected points together in a single figure.  However, when I tried reprojecting my data, this is the plot I get:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PBwv1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The points in red are the original image coordinates while the points in blue are reprojected onto the basis vectors to try and remove the rotation.  It still doesn't quite do the job.  There is still some orientation with respect to the points so if I tried to do my scanline algorithm, points from the lines below for horizontal tracing or to the side for vertical tracing would be inadvertently grouped and this isn't correct.</p>

<hr>

<p>Perhaps I'm overthinking the problem, but any insights you have regarding this would be greatly appreciated.  If the answer is indeed superb, I would be inclined to award a high bounty as I've been stuck on this problem for quite some time.</p>

<p>I hope this question wasn't long winded.  If you don't have an idea of how to solve this, then I thank you for your time in reading my question regardless.</p>

<p>Looking forward to any insights that you may have.  Thanks very much!</p>

<p>I recently wrote a simple routine in Matlab that uses an FFT in a for-loop; the FFT dominates the calculations. I wrote the same routine in mex just for experimentation purposes and it calls the FFTW 3.3 library. It turns out that the matlab routine runs faster than the mex routine for very large arrays (about twice as fast). The mex routine uses wisdom and and performs the same FFT calculations. I also know matlab uses FFTW, but is it possible their version is slightly more optimized? I even used the FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE flag and its still about twice as slow for large arrays than the MATLAB counterpart. Furthermore I ensured the matlab I used was single threaded with the ""-singleCompThread"" flag and the mex file I used was not in debug mode. Just curious if this was the case - or if there are some optimizations matlab is using under the hood that I dont know about. Thanks.</p>

<ul>
<li>standard (using integers along each dimension),</li>
<li>logical (using logical values),</li>
<li>linear (using a single index to traverse an array with more than one dimension).</li>
</ul>

<p>At first sight, it may appear that these forms are exclusive: an index is either standard, or logical, or linear. However, sometimes there appears to be a blend between several of these forms. For example,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; A = magic(3)
A =
     8     1     6
     3     5     7
     4     9     2
&gt;&gt; A(A&gt;5)
ans =
     8
     9
     6
     7
</code></pre>

<p>This is logical indexing, right? But it also has some features of linear indexing, because a column vector is returned. In fact, the logical index <code>A&gt;5</code> has the same effect as the linear index <code>find(A&gt;5)</code>. </p>

<p>As a second example, consider</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; A = magic(3)
A =
     8     1     6
     3     5     7
     4     9     2
&gt;&gt; A(1:2, [true false true])
ans =
     8     6
     3     7
</code></pre>

<p>In this expression, standard (integer-valued) indexing is used for the first coordinate, and logical indexing is used for the second.</p>

<p>These examples (and more complicated ones that arise in practice) pose the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What types of indexing are there in Matlab?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How can they be combined?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How should they be referred to?</strong></li>

my_data = np.random.rand(1500000, 3)*10
np.savetxt('./test.csv', my_data, delimiter=',', fmt='%.2f')

stmt1 = """"""\
my_data = np.genfromtxt('./test.csv', delimiter=',')
""""""
stmt2 = """"""\
my_data = np.loadtxt('./test.csv', delimiter=',')

t1 = timeit.timeit(stmt=stmt1, setup=setup_stmt, number=3)
t2 = timeit.timeit(stmt=stmt2, setup=setup_stmt, number=3)

<p>The result shows: Elapsed time is <strong>3.196465 seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>I understand that there may be some differences in the loading speed, but:  </p>

<ol>
<li>This is much more than I expected;  </li>
<li>Isn't it that np.loadtxt should be faster than np.genfromtxt?  </li>
<li>I haven't tried python csv module yet because loading csv file is a really frequent thing I do and with the csv module, the coding is a little bit verbose... But I'd be happy to try it if that's the only way. Currently I am more concerned about whether it's me doing something wrong.  </li>

197,197,1478471506.0,Stack Overflow,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40455299/does-matlab-accept-non-integer-indices,Does Matlab accept non-integer indices?,"<p>Of course not! ...Or does it? Let's do some tests.</p>

<p>Define <code>x = [10 20 30 40 50]</code>. Then any of the following statements, as expected, gives an error in <strong>Matlab</strong> (<em>Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals</em>): </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x(1.2)
&gt;&gt; x(-0.3)
&gt;&gt; x([1.4 2 3])
&gt;&gt; x([1.4 2.4 3.4])
&gt;&gt; x([1.4:4])
&gt;&gt; x(end/2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, non-integer values are accepted in <strong>colon indices</strong>. All of the following work in recent Matlab versions, although with a warning (<em>Integer operands are required for colon operator when used as index</em>).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x(1.2:3)
ans =
    10    20

&gt;&gt; x(0.4:3)
ans =
    10    10    20

&gt;&gt; x(0.6:3)
ans =
    10    20    30

&gt;&gt; x(1.2:0.7:5)
ans =
    10    20    30    30    40    50

&gt;&gt; x(-0.4:3)
ans =
    10    10    20    30
</code></pre>

<p>It also works if the colon expression includes <code>end</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x(1.5:end-2)
ans =
    20    30

&gt;&gt; x(1.5:end/6:end-1)
ans =
    20    20    30    40
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, the following do not work, and give the same error as above:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x(-0.6:2)
&gt;&gt; x(-0.5:2)
</code></pre>

<p>The observed behaviour can be <strong>summarized</strong> as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some <strong>internal rounding</strong> kicks in when a <strong>colon index</strong> is used. A colon index is an expression of the form <code>a:b</code> or <code>a:b:c</code>. No rounding takes place when the indexing array is a standard array, such as <code>[a b c]</code> or even <code>[a:b]</code> or <code>[a:b:c]</code>.</li>
<li>Rounding is done to the <strong>nearest integer</strong>, except that numbers between <code>-0.5</code> and <code>0.5</code> are <strong>special-cased</strong>: they are rounded to <code>1</code> instead of to <code>0</code>. Of course, if the integer resulting from the rounding is negative an error occurs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar behaviour is seen in recent versions of <strong>Octave</strong>, except that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Apparently, normal rounding to the nearest integer is done, without treating numbers between <code>-0.5</code> and <code>0.5</code> as a special case; and so these give an error:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x(0.4:3)
&gt;&gt; x(-0.4:3)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>An error is issued when the non-integer range contains a single value: <code>x(2.4:4)</code> works, but <code>x(3.4:4)</code> doesn't (of course, <code>x([2.4 3.4])</code> and <code>x(3.4)</code> don't work either).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other than this, the results are the same as in Matlab, and a warning is also issued (<em>Non-integer range used as index</em>).</p>

<p>The warnings and the fact that Octave works similarly as Matlab suggest that this is <strong>intended</strong> behaviour. Is it <strong>documented</strong> somewhere? Can anyone give <strong>more infromation</strong> or shed some light on this?</p>

I wanted to embed with a mex file written in C.  This worked fine for small simple examples using scalars.  However, if Numpy (1.6.1) is imported in anyway MATLAB crashes.  I say anyway because I have tried a number of ways to load the numpy libraries including</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import *

<li><p>With <code>PyRun_SimpleString</code> in the mex file:</p>

<li><p>Calling numpy functions with <code>Py_oBject_CallObject</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pOut  = PyObject_CallObject(pFunc, pArgs); 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Originally, I thought this may be a problem with embedding Numpy in C.  However, Numpy works fine when embedded in simple C files that are compiled from the command line with /MD (multithread) switch with the Visual Studios 2005 C compiler.   Next, I thought I will just change the make file in MATLAB to include the /MD switch.  No such luck, mexopts.bat compiles with the /MD switch.  I also manually commented out lines in the Numpy init module to find what was crashing MATLAB.  It seems that loading any file with the extension pyd crashes MATLAB.  The first of such files loaded in NumPy is multiarray.pyd.   The MATLAB documentation describes how to debug mex files with visual studios which I did and placed the error message below.  At this point I know the problem is a memory problem with the pyd’s and some conflict with MATLAB.  Interestingly, I can use a system command in MATLAB to kick off a process in python that uses numpy and no error is generated.  I will paste below the error message from MATLAB followed by the DEBUG output in visual studios of the processes that crash MATLAB.  However, I am not pasting the whole thing because the list of first-chance exceptions is very long.   Are there any suggestions for solving this integration problem?</p>

<p>Pointing out that (it does not affect the question or the answer, only the variable names in my code) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since my 4 cameras are in fact a stereo camera moving in the space,
  the 4 cameras (and relative outputs) are: </p>
  
  <p><br><em>Bottom left</em>: left camera named <strong>a</strong>. The features in this image
  are <code>fa</code>, descriptors <code>da</code>... <br><em>Bottom right</em>: left camera
  named <strong>a</strong>. The features in this image are <code>fb</code>, descriptors
  <code>db</code>... <br><em>Top left</em>: left camera named <strong>a</strong> in the previous
  instant. The features in this image are <code>fa_old</code>, descriptors
  <code>da_old</code>... <br><em>Top right</em>: right camera named <strong>b</strong> in the
  previous instant. The features in this image are <code>fb_old</code>, descriptors
  <code>db_old</code>...</p>
  
  <p>Movements are smaller so I expected that SIFT could retrieve the same points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This code finds points and performs the ""blue matching"" and ""red matching""</p>

<pre><code>%classic instruction for searching feature
    [fa,da] = vl_sift((Ia_f),'NormThresh', thresh_N, 'EdgeThresh', thresh_E) ;

%fa are features in the current left image (da are descriptors)
%fb are features in the current right image (db... )

</code></pre>

<p>All works. I thought to repeat few lines of code and find the proper <code>matches_ex_M</code> index array <strong>in the proper order</strong> and finally connect the feature in the last (top right) image (with any one of the other images)</p>

<pre><code>% one of many tries (all wrong)
[matches_ex, scores_ex] = vl_ubcmatch(da_old,db_old,thresh_SIFT) ;
[drop_ex, perm_ex] = sort(scores_ex, 'descend') ;
matches_ex = matches_ex(:, perm_ex);
Ib = intersect(matches_prev_M(2,:), matches_ex(1,:),'stable');
MIb_2 = arrayfun(@(x)find(matches_ex(1,:)==x,1),Ib);
matches_ex_M = matches_ex(:,MIb_2(:));
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that a new intersection will cause a new reorder, and all the matches will be wrong. 
But I have admitted I have no more ideas, after trying all possible combinations of matching index arrays. The problem is that I can't perform either intersection between 3 arrays simultaneously, nor changing their order. Featured are well displayed in all 4 images and I can perform single matches from any image to another in different scripts. In the top right images, there are the same features but with different order. </p>

<p>Synthesizing my problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought I should change the order of the points in the top right
  frame to have a good ""yellow"" matching, but I don't know how to make
  it without changing the order in the top left (this will destroy the
  ""red"" matching"" and/or the ""blue matching"")</p>

<p>Any idea? Any different strategies?

<p>In the following figure, I added by hand the possible (global) turning points that an algorithm could return:</p>

<p>Obviously, the true turning point is always debatable and will depend on the angle that one specifies that has to lie between points. Furthermore a turning point can be defined on a global scale (what I tried to do with the black circles), but could also be defined on a high-resolution local scale. I'm interested in the global (overall) direction changes, but I'd love to see a discussion on the different approaches that one would use to tease apart global vs local solutions. </p>

<p>What I've tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>calculate distance between subsequent points</li>
<li>calculate angle between subsequent points</li>
<li>look how distance / angle changes between subsequent points</li>

<p>Unfortunately this doesn't give me any robust results. I probably have too calculate the curvature along multiple points, but that's just an idea.

(There are good reasons MATLAB is being used to build this GUI, that is not the point of this question. I realize GUI-building is not a strong suit for this language.)</p>

<p>There are quite a few ways to share data between functions in a GUI, or even pass data between GUIs within an application:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>setappdata/getappdata/_____appdata</code> - associate arbitrary data to a handle</li>
<li><code>guidata</code> - typically used with GUIDE; ""store[s] or retrieve[s] GUI data"" to a structure of handles</li>
<li>Apply a <code>set/get</code> operation to the <code>UserData</code> property of a handle object</li>
<li>Use nested functions within a main function; basically emulates ""globally"" scoping variables.</li>
<li>Pass the data back and forth among subfunctions</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure for my code is not the prettiest. Right now I have the engine segregated from the front-end (good!) but the GUI code is pretty spaghetti-like. Here's a skeleton of an ""activity"", to borrow Android-speak:</p>

<pre><code>function myGui

    fig = figure(...); 

    % h is a struct that contains handles to all the ui objects to be instantiated. My convention is to have the first field be the uicontrol type I'm instantiating. See draw_gui nested function

    h = struct([]);


    draw_gui;
    set_callbacks; % Basically a bunch of set(h.(...), 'Callback', @(src, event) callback) calls would occur here

    %% DRAW FUNCTIONS

    function draw_gui
        h.Panel.Panel1 = uipanel(...
            'Parent', fig, ...
            ...);

        h.Panel.Panel2 = uipanel(...
            'Parent', fig, ...
            ...);


        draw_panel1;
        draw_panel2;

        function draw_panel1
             h.Edit.Panel1.thing1 = uicontrol('Parent', h.Panel.Panel1, ...);
        end
        function draw_panel2
             h.Edit.Panel2.thing1 = uicontrol('Parent', h.Panel.Panel2, ...);
        end


    end

    %% CALLBACK FUNCTIONS
    % Setting/getting application data is done by set/getappdata(fig, 'Foo').
end
</code></pre>

<p>I have previously-written code where nothing is nested, so I ended up passing <code>h</code> back and forth everywhere (since stuff needed to be redrawn, updated, etc) and <code>setappdata(fig)</code> to store actual data. In any case, I've been keeping one ""activity"" in a single file, and I'm sure this is going to be a maintenance nightmare in the future. Callbacks are interacting with both application data and graphical handle objects, which I suppose is necessary, but that's preventing a complete segregation of the two ""halves"" of the code base.</p>

<p>So I'm looking for some organizational/GUI design help here. Namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a directory structure I ought to be using to organize? (Callbacks vs drawing functions?)</li>
<li>What's the ""right way"" to interact with GUI data and keep it segregated from application data? (When I refer to GUI data I mean <code>set/get</code>ting properties of handle objects).</li>
<li>How do I avoid putting all these drawing functions into one giant file of thousands of lines and still efficiently pass both application and GUI data back and forth? Is that possible?</li>
<li>Is there any performance penalty associated with constantly using <code>set/getappdata</code>?</li>
<li>Is there any structure my back-end code (3 object classes and a bunch of helper functions) should take to make it easier to maintain from a GUI perspective?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not a software engineer by trade, I just know enough to be dangerous, so I'm sure these are fairly basic questions for seasoned GUI developers (in any language). I almost feel like the lack of a GUI design standard in MATLAB (does one exist?) is seriously interfering with my ability to complete this project. This is a MATLAB project that is much more massive than any I've ever undertaken, and I've never had to give much thought to complicated UIs with multiple figure windows, etc., before.</p>

Please, feel free to comment or complement this list. I verified it with r2006a.</p>

<hr>

<p>MATLAB <strong>always</strong> returns first output argument of a function (if it has at least one) into its caller workspace, also unexpectedly if function is being called without returning arguments like <code>myFunc1(); myFunc2();</code> the caller workspace still would contain first output of <code>myFunc2();</code> as ""invisible"" <code>ans</code> variable. It could play an important role if <code>ans</code> is a reference object - it would remain alive.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>set([], 'Background:Color','red')
</code></pre>

<p>MATLAB is very forgiving sometimes. In this case, setting properties to an array of objects works also with nonsense properties, at least when the array is empty. Such arrays usually come from <code>harray = findobj(0,'Tag','NotExistingTag')</code></p>

<hr>

<pre><code>myArray([1,round(end/2)])
</code></pre>

<p>This use of <code>end</code> keyword may seem unclean but is sometimes very handy instead of using <code>length(myArray)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>any([]) ~= all([])
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisigly <code>any([])</code> returns <code>false</code> and <code>all([])</code> returns <code>true</code>. And I always thought that <code>all</code> is stronger then <code>any</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>with <em>not empty</em> argument <code>all()</code> returns <code>true</code> for a subset of values for which <code>any()</code> returns <code>true</code> (e.g. truth table). This means that <code>any()</code> <code>false</code> implies <code>all()</code> <code>false</code>. This simple rule is being violated by MATLAB with <code>[]</code> as argument.</p>

<p>Loren also <a href=""http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2009/11/12/empty-arrays-with-flow-of-control-and-logical-operators/"" rel=""noreferrer"">blogged about it</a>.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>Select(Range(ExcelComObj))
</code></pre>

<p>Procedural style COM object method dispatch. Do not wonder that <code>exist('Select')</code> returns zero!</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>[myString, myCell]
</code></pre>

<p>MATLAB makes in this case an implicit cast of string variable <code>myString</code> to cell type <code>{myString}</code>. It works, also if I would not expect it to do so.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>[double(1.8), uint8(123)] =&gt; 2 123
</code></pre>

<p>Another cast example. Everybody would probably expect <code>uint8</code> value being cast to <code>double</code> but Mathworks have another opinion. Without a warning this behavior is very dangerous.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>a = 5;
b = a();
</code></pre>

<p>It looks silly but you can call a variable with round brackets. Actually it makes sense because this way you can execute a function given its handle.</p>

<hr>

<p>Syntax <code>Foo(:)</code> works not only on data but also with functions if called as <code>Bar.Foo(:)</code>, in this scenario the function input argument is passed as char <em>colon</em> <code>':'</code>. </p>

<p>For example let <code>Bar.Foo = @(x) disp(x)</code>
Now calling <code>Bar.Foo(:)</code> prints char <code>':'</code> in the MATLAB Command Window.</p>

<p>This strange feature works with all MATLAB 7 versions without warnings.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>a = {'aa', 'bb'
'cc', 'dd'};
</code></pre>

<p>Surprsisingly this code neither returns a vector nor rises an error but defins matrix, using just code layout. It is probably a relict from ancient times.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> very handy feature, see the comment by gnovice.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>set(hobj, {'BackgroundColor','ForegroundColor'},{'red','blue'})
</code></pre>

<p>This code does what you probably expect it to do. That function <code>set</code> accepts a struct as its second argument is a known fact and makes sense, and this sintax is just a <code>cell2struct</code> away.</p>

<hr>

<p>Equvalence rules are sometimes unexpected at first. For example <code>'A'==65</code> returns true (although for C-experts it is self-evident). Similarly <code>isequal([],{})</code> retuns, as expected, <code>false</code> and <code>isequal([],'')</code> returns <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>The string-numeric equivalence means that all string functions can be used also for numeric arrays, for example to find indices of a sub-array in a large array:</p>

<pre><code>ind = strfind( [1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ], [2 3] )
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>MATLAB function <code>isnumeric()</code> returns <code>false</code> for booleans. This feels just ... false :-)</p>

    1   2
&gt;&gt; x(end+1) = 4

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x(1:min(5, end))
ans =
    1   2   3   4

<p>I thought that <code>end</code> might be a special form, like <code>:</code>, that can be special-cased in indexing operations, so I created a class to detect this</p>

<pre><code>classdef IndexDisplayer
  methods
    function subsref(self, s)
      disp(s);
    end
  end
end

<p>You can see how <code>:</code> is special cased in the following example</p>

&gt;&gt; a(1:3)
    type: '()'
    subs: {[1 2 3]}
&gt;&gt; a(:)

<p>However, when I index with <code>end</code> I just see</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a(end)
    type: '()'
    subs: {[1]}
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>end</code> is replaced with a <code>1</code>. Where does that <code>1</code> come from? My first guess was that any <code>end</code> inside an indexing expression <code>x(end)</code> would be replaced with a call to <code>length(x)</code> so I tried overriding <code>length</code> as well</p>

<pre><code>classdef IndexDisplayer
  methods
    function subsref(self, s)
      disp(s);
    end
    function len = length(self)
      len = 10;
    end
  end
end

<p>However, that gives</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a = IndexDisplayer;
&gt;&gt; length(a)
ans =
    10

<p>I'm  looking for an elegant way to subtract the same vector from each row of a matrix.  Here is a non elegant way of doing it.</p>

<p>One can see how <code>A==0</code> performs better than <code>~A</code> across all datasizes. So here are some observations and related questions alongside them –</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>A==0</code> has one relational operator and one operand, whereas <code>~A</code> has only one relational operator. Both produce logical arrays and both accept double arrays. In fact, <code>A==0</code> would work with <code>NaNs</code> too, wheras <code>~A</code> won’t. So, why is still <code>~A</code> at least not as good as <code>A==0</code> as it looks like <code>A==0</code> is doing more work or am I missing something here?</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a peculiar drop of elapsed time with <code>A==0</code> and thus increased performance at <code>N = 320</code>, i.e. at <code>102400</code> elements for A. I have observed this across many runs with that size on two different systems that I have access to. So what’s going on there?</p></li>

I have achieved clustering using K-Means and was seeing how GMM would compare to K-means.</p>

<p>Here is what I have understood, please let me know if my concept is wrong:</p>

<p>GMM is like KNN, in the sense that clustering is achieved in both cases. But in GMM each cluster has their own independent mean and covariance. Furthermore k-means performs hard assignments of data points to clusters whereas in GMM we get a collection of independant gaussian distributions, and for each data point we have a probability that it belongs to one of the distributions.</p>

<p>To understand it better I have used MatLab to code it and achieve the desired clustering. I have used SIFT features for the purpose of feature extraction. And have used k-means clustering to initialize the values. (This is from the <a href=""http://www.vlfeat.org/overview/gmm.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">VLFeat</a> documentation)</p>

<pre><code>%images is a 459 x 1 cell array where each cell contains the training image
[locations, all_feats] = vl_dsift(single(images{1}), 'fast', 'step', 50); %all_feats will be 128 x no. of keypoints detected
for i=2:(size(images,1))
    [locations, feats] = vl_dsift(single(images{i}), 'fast', 'step', 50);
    all_feats = cat(2, all_feats, feats); %cat column wise all features
end

numClusters = 50; %Just a random selection.
% Run KMeans to pre-cluster the data
[initMeans, assignments] = vl_kmeans(single(all_feats), numClusters, ...
    'Algorithm','Lloyd', ...
    'MaxNumIterations',5);

initMeans = double(initMeans); %GMM needs it to be double

% Find the initial means, covariances and priors
for i=1:numClusters
    data_k = all_feats(:,assignments==i);
    initPriors(i) = size(data_k,2) / numClusters;

    if size(data_k,1) == 0 || size(data_k,2) == 0
        initCovariances(:,i) = diag(cov(data'));
    else
        initCovariances(:,i) = double(diag(cov(double((data_k')))));
    end
end

% Run EM starting from the given parameters
[means,covariances,priors,ll,posteriors] = vl_gmm(double(all_feats), numClusters, ...
    'initialization','custom', ...
    'InitMeans',initMeans, ...
    'InitCovariances',initCovariances, ...
    'InitPriors',initPriors);
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the above I have <code>means</code>, <code>covariances</code> and <code>priors</code>. My main question is, What now? I am kind of lost now.</p>

<p>Also the <code>means</code>, <code>covariances</code> vectors are each of the size <code>128 x 50</code>. I was expecting them to be <code>1 x 50</code> since each column is a cluster, wont each cluster have only one mean and covariance? (I know 128 are the SIFT features but I was expecting means and covariances).</p>

<p>In k-means I used the the MatLab command <code>knnsearch(X,Y)</code> which basically finds the nearest neighbour in X for each point in Y. </p>

<p>So how to achieve this in GMM, I know its a collection of probabilities, and ofcourse the nearest match from that probability will be our winning cluster. And this is where I am confused. 
All tutorials online have taught how to achieve the <code>means</code>, <code>covariances</code> values, but do not say much in how to actually use them in terms of clustering.</p>

<p>And it remembers it, too:</p>

<pre><code>octave:3&gt; abomination

<p>In the interest of sanity, negative zero does equal regular zero.  But I also noticed that the sign has some other effects.  Like these:</p>

Are there some attractive mathematical properties for having this?  Does this matter in certain fields of mathematics?</p>

The figure is displayed when the function is executed. I need to save the figure as a JPEG image. To do that, I could do File->Save As in the figure window that displays the figure. But I'd like to automate this. I've tried to do that using the saveas() function. The problem is that the resulting image is undesirable. Here are the images for a demo problem to show you what I mean:</p>

<p><strong>JPEG image saved manually using File->Save As in the MATLAB figure window:</strong>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qC6L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qC6L.jpg"" alt=""saveas jpg rendering""></a></p>

<p>Here is the MATLAB function in which I generate the figure and save the figure as a JPEG using saveas():</p>

<pre><code>function JpgSaveIssueDemo( )
    figure( 1 );
    t = 0:0.1:8;    

    subplot( 2, 2, 1 );    
    plot( t, sin(t) );
    title( 'Plot 1 of Example to Demonstrate JPG Save Issue', 'FontSize', 18 );

    subplot( 2, 2, 2 );
    plot( t, sin(t) );
    title( 'Plot 2 of Example to Demonstrate JPG Save Issue', 'FontSize', 18 );

    subplot( 2, 2, 3 );
    plot( t, sin(t) );
    title( 'Plot 3 of Example to Demonstrate JPG Save Issue', 'FontSize', 18 );

    subplot( 2, 2, 4 );
    plot( t, sin(t) );
    title( 'Plot 4 of Example to Demonstrate JPG Save Issue', 'FontSize', 18 );

    saveas( gcf, 'DemoPlot', 'jpg' );
end
</code></pre>

<p>The figure that is displayed when JpgSaveIssueDemo() is executed isn't maximized. So, I thought that if I could maximize it using function call/s in JpgSaveIssueDemo() <em>before</em> saveas() is executed, then the JPEG image saved would come out well.</p>

<p>So, I used this code before the saveas() line in JpgSaveIssueDemo() to maximize the figure:</p>

<pre><code>drawnow;
jFrame = get(handle(gcf),'JavaFrame'); 
jFrame.setMaximized(true);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the figure that is displayed is maximized. However, the result is the same: the JPEG image still comes out undesirably.</p>

<p>I got the following response from Matlab when I contacted them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I know this is the default .NET behavior when it comes to
deserializations. The application which deserializes the class looks
for the assembly in its own current folder and GAC where it cannot
find it. It is similar to (when you read this replace MATLAB with
Nunit)</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/101695-why-can-my-assembly-not-be-found-when-deserializing-a-net-object-in-matlab-7-10-r2010a"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/101695-why-can-my-assembly-not-be-found-when-deserializing-a-net-object-in-matlab-7-10-r2010a</a></p>
<p>You example does not represent the situation when MATLAB is involved.
MATLAB sends the class across APPDomains. Your example does not do
that.</p>
<p>Use Fuslogvw to have a look at the binding.  You will see that it is
not MATLAB which cannot find the assembly it’s the calling application
which is unable to resolve the dependency (in your case
nunit-agent-x86.exe).</p>

I was under the impression that for basic array manipulation, Numpy would be as fast as MATLAB. However, it appears for two different programs I write that MATLAB is a little under twice as fast as Numpy. The test code I am using for Numpy (Python 3.3) is:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

a[:,:,2] = a[:,:,0]
a[:,:,1] = a[:,:,2]

tic;
a(:,:,1) = a(:,:,2);
a(:,:,3) = a(:,:,1);
a(:,:,2) = a(:,:,3);

<p>I tried several methods such as sorting the array (using std::sort) and picking the middle entry but it is extremely slow when comparing with the median function in matlab. To be precise - what takes 0.25 seconds in matlab takes over 19 seconds in openCV.</p>

<p>My input image is originally a 12-bit greyscale image with the dimensions 3840x2748 (~10.5 megapixels), converted to float (CV_32FC1) where all the values are now mapped to the range [0,1] and at some point in the code I request the median value by calling:</p>

    return vecFromMat[(vecFromMat.size()-1)/2]; // odd-number of elements in matrix
}
</code></pre>

<p>I timed the function medinaMat by itself and also the various parts - as expected the bottleneck is in:</p>

<pre><code>  std::sort( vecFromMat.begin(), vecFromMat.end() ); // sort vecFromMat
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone here have an efficient solution?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I have tried using std::nth_element given in the answer of Adi Shavit.</p>

std::nth_element(vecFromMat.begin(), vecFromMat.begin() + vecFromMat.size() / 2, vecFromMat.end());
return vecFromMat[vecFromMat.size() / 2];}

<p>What is the right way to structure multivariate data with categorical labels accumulated over repeated trials for exploratory analysis in R? I don't want to slip back to MATLAB.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>I like R's analysis functions and syntax (and stunning plots) much better than MATLAB's, and have been working hard to refactor my stuff over. However, I keep getting hung up on the way data is organized in my work.</p>

<h3>MATLAB</h3>

<p>It's typical for me to work with multivariate time series repeated over many trials, which are stored in a big <strike>matrix</strike> <strike>rank-3 tensor</strike> multidimensional array of SERIESxSAMPLESxTRIALS. This lends itself to some nice linear algebra stuff occasionally, but is clumsy when it comes to another variable, namely CLASS. Typically class labels are stored in another vector of dimension 1x<code>TRIALS</code>.</p>

<p>When it comes to analysis I basically plot as little as possible, because it takes so much work to get together a really good plot that teaches you a lot about the data in MATLAB. (<a href=""http://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/"">I'm not the only one who feels this way</a>).</p>

<h3>R</h3>

<p>In R I've been sticking as close as I can to the MATLAB structure, but things get annoyingly complex when trying to keep the class labeling separate; I'd have to keep passing the labels into functions in even though I'm only using their attributes. So what I've done is separate the array into a list of arrays by CLASS. This adds complexity to all of my <code>apply()</code> functions, but seems to be worth it in terms of keeping things consistent (and bugs out).</p>

<p>On the other hand, R just doesn't seem to be friendly with tensors/multidimensional arrays. Just to work with them, you need to grab the <code>abind</code> library. Documentation on <a href=""http://little-book-of-r-for-multivariate-analysis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/src/multivariateanalysis.html"">multivariate analysis, like this example</a> seems to operate under the assumption that you have a huge 2-D table of data points like <strike>some long medieval scroll</strike> a data frame, and doesn't mention how to get 'there' from where I am.</p>

<p>Once I get to plotting and classifying the processed data, it's not such a big problem, since by then I've worked my way down to data frame-friendly structures with shapes like TRIALSxFEATURES (<code>melt</code> has helped a lot with this). On the other hand, if I want to quickly generate a scatterplot matrix or latticist histogram set for the exploratory phase (i.e. statistical moments, separation, in/between-class variance, histograms, etc.), I have to stop and figure out how I'm going to <code>apply()</code> these huge multidimensional arrays into something those libraries understand.</p>

<p>If I keep pounding around in the jungle coming up with ad-hoc solutions for this, I'm either never going to get better or I'll end up with my own weird wizardly ways of doing it that don't make sense to anybody.</p>

<p>So what's the <em>right</em> way to structure multivariate data with categorical labels accumulated over repeated trials for exploratory analysis in R? Please, I don't want to slip back to MATLAB.</p>

<p>Bonus: I tend to repeat these analyses over identical data structures for multiple subjects. Is there a better general way than wrapping the code chunks into <code>for</code> loops?</p>

One way to do this is to exploit the fact that the index of refraction of the fluid is directly related to its density. If you set up some kind of image behind the flow, the distortion in the image due to refractive index changes throughout the fluid field leads you to a density gradient, which helps to characterize the flow pattern.</p>

<p>I have a set of routines that do this successfully with a regular 2D pattern of dots. The dot pattern is slightly distorted, and by comparing the position of the dots in the distorted image with that in the non-distorted image, I get a displacement field, which is exactly what I need. The problem with this method is resolution. The resolution is limited to the number of dots in the field, and I'm exploring methods that give me more data.</p>

<p>One idea I've had is to use a regular grid of horizontal and vertical lines. This image will distort the same way, but instead of getting only the displacement of a dot, I'll have the continuous distortion of a grid. It seems like there must be some standard algorithm or procedure to compare one geometric grid to another and infer some kind of displacement field. Nonetheless, I haven't found anything like this in my research.</p>

<p>where <code>A</code> is an <code>m x n</code> matrix of complex numbers and <code>w</code> is an <code>m x 1</code> vector of real numbers.</p>

<h2><strong>Bottle-neck</strong></h2>

<p>This is the expression for <code>R(i,j)</code> which is the slowest part of the function (not 100% sure if the notation is correct):

<p>where <code>w</code> is a non-negative weight function.
The weighted inner-product is mentioned on several Wikipedia pages, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function#Inner_product"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this is one on the weight function</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality#Orthogonal_functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this is one on orthogonal functions</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Reproduction</strong></h2>

<p>You can produce results using the following script:</p>

<pre><code>A = complex( rand(360000,100), rand(360000,100));
w = rand(360000, 1);
[Q, R] = Gram_Schmidt(A, w);

<p>where <code>A</code> and <code>w</code> are the inputs. </p>

<h2><strong>Speed and Computation</strong></h2>

<p>If you use the above script you will get profiler results synonymous to the following:

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x4Q7l.png"" alt=""Profiler Code Times""></p>

<h2><strong>Testing Result</strong></h2>

<p>You can test the results by comparing a function with the one above using the following script:</p>

<pre><code>A = complex( rand( 100, 10), rand( 100, 10));
w = rand( 100, 1);
[Q , R ] = Gram_Schmidt( A, w);
[Q2, R2] = Gram_Schmidt2( A, w);
zeros1 = norm( Q - Q2 );
zeros2 = norm( R - R2 );
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>Gram_Schmidt</code> is the function described earlier and <code>Gram_Schmidt2</code> is an alternative function. The results <code>zeros1</code> and <code>zeros2</code> should then be very close to zero.</p>

Before I proceed any further in describing my attempt on this problem, I would like to mention that I am totally new to audio analysis though I have a lot of experience with analyzing images and videos.</p>

<p>After googling a bit, I found a bunch of melody extraction algorithms. Given a polyphonic audio signal of a song (ex: .wav file), they output a pitch track --- at each point in time they estimate the dominant pitch (coming from a singer's voice or some melody generating instrument) and track the dominant pitch over time. </p>

<p>I read a few papers, and they seem to compute a short time Fourier transform of the song, and then do some analysis on the spectrogram to get and track the dominant pitch. Melody extraction is only a component in the system I am trying to develop, so I don't mind using any algorithm that's available as far as it does a decent job on my audio files and the code is available. Since I am new to this, I would be happy to hear any suggestions on which algorithms are known to work well and where can I find its code.</p>

<p>I found two algorithms:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/zahorian/yaapt.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Yaapt pitch tracking</a> </li>
<li><a href=""http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/melodia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Melodia</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I chose Melodia as the results on different music genres looked quite impressive. Please check <a href=""http://www.justinsalamon.com/melody-extraction.html#demo"" rel=""noreferrer"">this to see its results</a>. The humming that you hear for each piece of music is essentially what I am interested in. </p>

<p>""It is the generation of this humming for any arbitrary song, that I want your help with in this question"".</p>

<p>The algorithm (available as a vamp plugin) outputs a pitch track --- [time_stamp, pitch/frequency] --- an Nx2 matrix where in the first column is the time-stamp (in seconds) and the second column is dominant pitch detected at the corresponding time-stamp. Shown below is a visualization of the pitch-track obtained from the algorithm overlayed in purple color with a song's time-domain signal (above) and it spectrogram/short-time-fourier. Negative-values of pitch/frequency represent the algorithms dominant pitch estimate for un-voiced/non-melodic segments. So all pitch estimates >= 0 correspond to the melody, the rest are not important to me.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MKF3V.png"" alt=""Pitch-track overlay with a song&#39;s waveform and spectrogram""></p>

<p>Now I want to convert this pitch track back to a humming like audio signal -- just like the authors have it on their website. </p>

<p>Below is a MATLAB function that I wrote to do this:</p>

<pre><code>function [melSignal] = melody2audio(melody, varargin)
% melSignal = melody2audio(melody, Fs, synthtype)
% melSignal = melody2audio(melody, Fs)
% melSignal = melody2audio(melody)
%
% Convert melody/pitch-track to a time-domain signal
%
% Inputs:
%
%     melody - [time-stamp, dominant-frequency] 
%           an Nx2 matrix with time-stamp in the 
%           first column and the detected dominant 
%           frequency at corresponding time-stamp
%           in the second column. 
% 
%     synthtype - string to choose synthesis method
%      passed to synth function in synth.m
%      current choices are: 'fm', 'sine' or 'saw'
%      default='fm'
% 
%     Fs - sampling frequency in Hz 
%       default = 44.1e3
%
%   Output:
%   
%     melSignal -- time-domain representation of the 
%                  melody. When you play this, you 
%                  are supposed to hear a humming
%                  of the input melody/pitch-track
% 

    p = inputParser;
    p.addRequired('melody', @isnumeric);
    p.addParamValue('Fs', 44100, @(x) isnumeric(x) &amp;&amp; isscalar(x));
    p.addParamValue('synthtype', 'fm', @(x) ismember(x, {'fm', 'sine', 'saw'}));
    p.addParamValue('amp', 60/127,  @(x) isnumeric(x) &amp;&amp; isscalar(x));
    p.parse(melody, varargin{:});

    parameters = p.Results;

    % get parameter values
    Fs = parameters.Fs;
    synthtype = parameters.synthtype;
    amp = parameters.amp;

    % generate melody
    numTimePoints = size(melody,1);
    endtime = melody(end,1);
    melSignal = zeros(1, ceil(endtime*Fs));

    h = waitbar(0, 'Generating Melody Audio' );

    for i = 1:numTimePoints

        % frequency
        freq = max(0, melody(i,2));

        % duration
        if i &gt; 1
            n1 = floor(melody(i-1,1)*Fs)+1;
            dur = melody(i,1) - melody(i-1,1);
        else
            n1 = 1;
            dur = melody(i,1);            
        end

        % synthesize/generate signal of given freq
        sig = synth(freq, dur, amp, Fs, synthtype);

        N = length(sig);

        % augment note to whole signal
        melSignal(n1:n1+N-1) = melSignal(n1:n1+N-1) + reshape(sig,1,[]);

        % update status
        waitbar(i/size(melody,1));

    end

    close(h);

end
</code></pre>

<p>The underlying logic behind this code is the following: at each time-stamp, I synthesize a short-lived wave (say a sine-wave) with frequency equal to the detected dominant pitch/frequency at that time-stamp for a duration equal to its gap with the next time-stamp in the input melody matrix. I only wonder if I am doing this right.</p>

<p>Then I take the audio signal I get from this function and play it with the original song (melody on the left channel and original song on the right channel). Though the generated audio signal seems to segment the melody-generating sources (voice/lead-intstrument) fairly well -- its active where voice is and zero everywhere else --- the signal itself is far from being a humming (I get something like beep beep beeeeep beep beeep beeeeeeeep) that the authors show on their website. Specifically, below is a visualization showing the time-domain signal of the input song in the bottom and the time-domain signal of the melody generated using my function.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfSeU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>One main issue is -- though I am given the frequency of the wave to generate at each time-stamp and also the duration, I don't know how to set the amplitude of the wave. For now, I set the amplitude to be flat/a-constant value, and i suspect this is where the problem is. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on this? I welcome suggestions in any program language (preferably MATLAB, python, C++), but I guess my question here is more general --- How to generate the wave at each time-stamp?</p>

<p>A few ideas/fixes in my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the amplitude by getting an averaged/max estimate of the amplitude from the time-domain signal of the original song.</li>
<li>Totally change my approach --- compute the spectrogram/short-time fourier transform of the song's audio signal. cut-off hardly/zero-out or softly all other frequencies except the ones in my pitch-track (or are close to my pitch-track). And then compute the inverse short-time fourier transform to get the time-domain signal.</li>

You can see that the title does not plot in the same format as a <code>title('whatever')</code> would plot in the new graphic handles.

Is there an alternative?,"<p>I've been trying to put together a gui in MATLAB and have had great difficulty. Here is a little background about my program: I want to create a wizard to step users through an image analysis process. The wizard will cue users for their input and then perform an image processing action once a button labeled ""Next"" has been pressed, and so on. From reading the MATLAB help I believe there are two approaches to gui creation: 1. write a gui with lines of code. 2. use GUIDE.</p>

<p>I figured GUIDE would have the shallowest learning curve. At first the process was straight-forward. I could drag and drop buttons and text boxes and arrange them easily. My plan was to arrange a series of panels, with the buttons and text and etc., that would sequentially become visible as the ""Next"" button was pressed. And it was here I became stumped.</p>

<p>Once I save a panel with GUIDE, MATLAB creates a .m file and a .fig file. Reading through the .m file I see it has left room for me to write code for the callbacks, but little else. The .fig file is binary and therefore I dare not bother edit it. I am left wondering how I can control the objects, e.g. How to set the visibility of a panel? Furthermore, I had to create each panel of the wizard separately. I was hoping that I could manually combine the .m files into a wizard.m wrapper file, but I do not think this is the right approach (at least for me, because I cannot see how to do it).</p>

<p>In lieu of using GUIDE I've seen examples where guis are created using the ""uicontrol"" function. This approach seems tedious to me, because I would have to manually code the position and size and defaults of each button. Perhaps this is the best approach, but it intimidates me.</p>

<p>As a result I am unhappy with MATLAB for its seemingly clunky gui tools and I am unhappy with myself for lacking the chops to overcome this hurdle.</p>

<p>I've seen some fancy guis created in MATLAB and having attempted this myself and falling way short I am baffled by their existence. Either whoever made them were exceptional MATLAB users (I am not), or I am missing something obvious and could use some help seeing. I am now questioning whether a gui is worth the effort. I do not see myself exploring something like QT, because of the additional challenge of embedding MATLAB code into other languages such as python.</p>

<p>Does anyone have advice on this subject? Can anyone please point out where I am going wrong or why I am having such difficulty?</p>

  <p><a href=""http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=OL-30-13-1641"" rel=""noreferrer"">Decomposition of biospeckle images in temporary spectral bands</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an explanation of the algorithm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We recorded a sequence of <code>N</code> successive speckle images with a sampling
  frequency <code>fs</code>. In this way it was possible to observe how a pixel
  evolves through the <code>N</code> images. That evolution can be treated as a time
  series and can be processed in the following way: Each signal
  corresponding to the evolution of every pixel was used as input to a
  bank of filters. The intensity values were previously divided by their
  temporal mean value to minimize local differences in reflectivity or
  illumination of the object. The maximum frequency that can be
  adequately analyzed is determined by the sampling theorem and s half
  of sampling frequency <code>fs</code>. The latter is set by the CCD camera, the
  size of the image, and the frame grabber. The bank of filters is
  outlined in Fig. 1.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G163I.jpg"" alt=""bank of filters""></p>
  
  <p>In our case, ten 5° order Butterworth filters
  were used, but this number can be varied according to the required
  discrimination. The bank was implemented in a computer using MATLAB
  software. We chose the Butter-worth filter because, in addition to its
  simplicity, it is maximally flat. Other filters, an infinite impulse
  response, or a finite impulse response could be used.</p>
  
  <p>By means of this
  bank of filters, ten corresponding signals of each filter of each
  temporary pixel evolution were obtained as output. Average energy Eb
  in each signal was then calculated:</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHo5L.png"" alt=""energy equation""></p>
  
  <p>where <code>pb(n)</code> is the intensity of the filtered pixel in the nth image
  for filter <code>b</code> divided by its mean value and <code>N</code> is the total number of
  images. In this way, <code>En</code> values of energy for each pixel were obtained,
  each of hem belonging to one of the frequency bands in Fig. 1.</p>
  
  <p>With these values it is possible to build ten images of the active object,
  each one of which shows how much energy of time-varying speckle there
  is in a certain frequency band. False color assignment to the gray
  levels in the results would help in discrimination.</p>

<p>I am implementing a tree data structure in MATLAB. Adding new child nodes to the tree, assigning and updating data values related to the nodes are typical operations that I expect to execute. Each node has the same type of <code>data</code> associated with it. Removing nodes is not necessary for me. So far, I've decided on a class implementation inheriting from the <code>handle</code> class to be able to pass references to nodes around to functions that will modify the tree.</p>

<h3>Edit: December 2nd</h3>

<p>First of all, thanks for all the suggestions in the comments and answers so far. They have already helped me to improve my tree class.</p>

<p>Someone suggested trying <a href=""http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/digraph.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>digraph</code></a> introduced in R2015b. I have yet to explore this, but seeing as it does not work as a reference parameter similarly to a class inheriting from <code>handle</code>, I am a bit sceptical how it will work in my application. It is also at this point not yet clear to me how easy it will be to work with it using custom <code>data</code> for nodes and edges.</p>

<h3>Edit: (Dec 3rd) Further information on the main application: MCTS</h3>

<p>Initially, I assumed the details of the main application would only be of marginal interest, but since reading the comments and the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/34062165/5471520"">answer</a> by @FirefoxMetzger, I realise that it has important implications.</p>

<p>I am implementing a type of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Monte Carlo tree search</a> algorithm. A search tree is explored and expanded in an iterative manner. Wikipedia offers a nice graphical overview of the process:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3vrS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3vrS.png"" alt=""Monte Carlo tree search""></a></p>

<p>In my application I perform a large number of search iterations. On every search iteration, I traverse the current tree starting from the root until a leaf node, then expand the tree by adding new nodes, and repeat. As the method is based on random sampling, at the start of each iteration I <strong>do not know which leaf node I will finish at on each iteration</strong>. Instead, this is determined jointly by the <code>data</code> of nodes currently in the tree, and the outcomes of random samples. Whatever nodes I visit during a single iteration have their <code>data</code> updated.</p>

<p>Example: I am at node <code>n</code> which has a few children. I need to access data in each of the children and draw a random sample that determines which of the children I move to next in the search. This is repeated until a leaf node is reached. Practically I am doing this by calling a <code>search</code> function on the root that will decide which child to expand next, call <code>search</code> on that node recursively, and so on, finally returning a value once a leaf node is reached. This value is used while returning from the recursive functions to update the <code>data</code> of the nodes visited during the search iteration.</p>

<p>The tree may be quite unbalanced such that some branches are very long chains of nodes, while others terminate quickly after the root level and are not expanded further.</p>

<h3>Current implementation</h3>

<p>Below is an example of my current implementation, with example of a few of the member functions for adding nodes, querying the depth or number of nodes in the tree, and so on.</p>

<pre><code>classdef stree &lt; handle
    %   A class for a tree object that acts like a reference
    %   parameter.
    %   The tree can be traversed in both directions by using the parent
    %   and children information.

    %   keep track of the number of nodes in the tree and increment the
    %   storage space as necessary.

    properties (SetAccess = private)
        % Hold the data at each node
        Node = { [] };
        % Index of the parent node. The root of the tree as a parent index
        % equal to 0.
        Parent = 0;
        num_nodes = 0;
        size_increment = 1;
        maxSize = 1;
    end

    methods
        function [obj, root_ID] = stree(data, init_siz)
            % New object with only root content, with specified initial

                obj.Parent(idx) = parent;
                obj.num_nodes = idx;

                    obj.Node

                obj.Parent = [

                obj.maxSize = numel(obj.Parent);

            end
            ID = obj.num_nodes;
        end

        function content = get(obj, ID)
            %% GET  Return the contents of the given node IDs.

        end
        function n = nnodes(obj)
            % NNODES  Return the number of nodes in the tree.
            % Equal to root + those whose parent is not root.
            n = 1 + sum(obj.Parent(1:obj.num_nodes) ~= 0);
            assert( obj.num_nodes == n);

            % ISLEAF  Return true if given ID matches a leaf node.
            % A leaf node is a node that has no children.
            flag = ~any( obj.Parent(1:obj.num_nodes) == ID );
        end

            % DEPTH return depth of tree under ID. If ID is not given, use
            % root.

                ID = 0;
            end
            if obj.isleaf(ID)
                depth = 0;
            else

                NC = numel(children);
                d = 0; % Depth from here on out
                for k = 1:NC
                    d = max(d, obj.depth(children(k)));
                end
                depth = 1 + d;
            end
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, performance at times is slow, with operations on the tree taking up most of my computation time. What specific ways would there be to make the implementation more efficient? It would even be possible to change the implementation to something else than the <code>handle</code> inheritance type if there are performance gains.</p>

<h2>Profiling results with current implementation</h2>

<p>As adding new nodes to the tree is the most typical operation (along with updating the <code>data</code> of a node), I did some <a href=""http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/profile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profiling</a> on that.
I ran the profiler on the following benchmarking code with <code>Nd=6, Ns=10</code>.</p>

<pre><code>function T = benchmark(Nd, Ns)
% Tree benchmark. Nd: tree depth, Ns: number of nodes per layer
% Initialize tree
T = stree(rand, 10000);
add_layers(1, Nd);
    function add_layers(node_id, num_layers)
        if num_layers == 0
            return;
        end
        child_id = zeros(Ns,1);
        for s = 1:Ns
            % add child to current node
            child_id(s) = T.addnode(node_id, rand);

            % recursively increase depth under child_id(s)
            add_layers(child_id(s), num_layers-1);
        end
    end
end

<hr>

<p>It has been discovered that R2015b <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1693429/is-matlab-oop-slow-or-am-i-doing-something-wrong"">improves the performance of MATLAB's OOP features</a>. I redid the above benchmark and indeed observed an improvement in performance:</p>

<p><strong>Reserving memory differently</strong></p>

<p>It was also suggested in the comments to use </p>

<pre><code>obj.Node = [obj.Node; data; cell(obj.size_increment - 1,1)];
</code></pre>

<p>to reserve more memory rather than the current approach with <code>repmat</code>. This improved performance slightly. I should note that my benchmark code is for dummy data, and since the actual <code>data</code> is more complicated this is likely to help. Thanks! Profiler results below:</p>

<h2>Questions on even further increasing performance</h2>

<ol>
<li>Perhaps there is an alternative way to maintain memory for the tree that is more efficient? Sadly, I typically don't know ahead of time how many nodes there will be in the tree.</li>
<li>Adding new nodes and modifying the <code>data</code> of existing nodes are the most typical operations I do on the tree. As of now, they actually take up most of the processing time of my main application. Any improvements on these functions would be most welcome.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just as a final note, I would ideally like to keep the implementation as pure MATLAB. However, options such as MEX or using some of the integrated Java functionalities may be acceptable.</p>

The platform measures roll, pitch and yaw angles, and I want to make it look like the image is taken from directly above, by some sort of transform from this information. </p>

<p>In other words, I want a perfect square lying flat on the ground, photographed from afar with some camera orientation, to be transformed, so that the square is perfectly symmetrical afterwards. </p>

<p>I have been trying to do this through OpenCV(C++) and Matlab, but I seem to be missing something fundamental about how this is done.</p>

<p>In Matlab, I have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>%% Transform perspective
img = imread('my_favourite_image.jpg');
R = R_z(yaw_angle)*R_y(pitch_angle)*R_x(roll_angle);
tform = projective2d(R);   
outputImage = imwarp(img,tform);
figure(1), imshow(outputImage);
</code></pre>

<p>Where R_z/y/x are the standard rotational matrices (implemented with degrees).</p>

<p>For some yaw-rotation, it all works just fine:</p>

<pre><code>R = R_z(10)*R_y(0)*R_x(0);
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives the result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pyiNq.jpg"" alt=""Image rotated 10 degrees about the Z-image axis""></p>

<p>If I try to rotate the image by the same amount about the X- or Y- axes, I get results like this:</p>

<pre><code>R = R_z(10)*R_y(0)*R_x(10);
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cbZoE.jpg"" alt=""Image rotated 10 degrees about the X-image axis""></p>

<p>However, if I rotate by 10 degrees, divided by some huge number, it starts to look OK. But then again, this is a result that has no research value what so ever:</p>

<pre><code>R = R_z(10)*R_y(0)*R_x(10/1000);
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kssGS.jpg"" alt=""Image rotated 10/1000 degrees about the X-image axis""></p>

<p>Can someone please help me understand why rotating about the X- or Y-axes makes the transformation go wild? Is there any way of solving this without dividing by some random number and other magic tricks? Is this maybe something that can be solved using Euler parameters of some sort? Any help will be highly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Update: Full setup and measurements</strong></p>

<p>For completeness, the full test code and initial image has been added, as well as the platforms Euler angles: </p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>%% Transform perspective
function [] = main()
    img = imread('some_image.jpg');
    R = R_z(0)*R_y(0)*R_x(10);
    tform = projective2d(R);   
    outputImage = imwarp(img,tform);
    figure(1), imshow(outputImage);
end

%% Matrix for Yaw-rotation about the Z-axis
function [R] = R_z(psi)
    R = [cosd(psi) -sind(psi) 0;
         sind(psi)  cosd(psi) 0;
         0          0         1];
end

%% Matrix for Pitch-rotation about the Y-axis
function [R] = R_y(theta)
    R = [cosd(theta)    0   sind(theta);
         0              1   0          ;
         -sind(theta)   0   cosd(theta)     ];
end

%% Matrix for Roll-rotation about the X-axis
function [R] = R_x(phi)
    R = [1  0           0;
         0  cosd(phi)   -sind(phi);
         0  sind(phi)   cosd(phi)];
end
</code></pre>

<p>The initial image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5e01.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Camera platform measurements in the BODY coordinate frame:</p>

<pre><code>Roll:     -10
Pitch:    -30
Yaw:      166 (angular deviation from north)
</code></pre>

<p>From what I understand the Yaw-angle is not directly relevant to the transformation. I might, however, be wrong about this.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info:</strong></p>

<p>I would like specify that the environment in which the setup will be used contains no lines (oceanic photo) that can reliably used as a reference (the horizon will usually not be in the picture). Also the square in the initial image is merely used as a measure to see if the transformation is correct, and will not be there in a real scenario.</p>

<p>Using jdde in MATLAB works fine, except for the first time after I reboot the computer or I logoff/logon in Windows. When I run the following code for the first time after a computer reboot, MATLAB will stay in busy mode forever (with 0% CPU).

<p>To sum it up, the above code will cause MATLAB to stay busy forever the first time I run it after a system reboot or user logoff/logon. When I run it again after killing the MATLAB process, it will work perfectly fine (not hanging up MATLAB).</p>

<p>I have seen this behavior on different computers, and in different Versions of MATLAB (2010 and 2012). I'm using Windows 7 x64.</p>

<p>In the code example, the a.connect command is the one that causes MATLAB to stay busy forever. Putting this command in a try/catch block would not help, because the a.connect doesn't cause an error, it just never does continue.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this problem is caused by MATLAB or by the java package.
Any ideas how to get rid of this behavior would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>If not, is there any better way to workaround this other than trying to pre-emptively set break points or dbstop statements in your matlab code? </p>

<p>I would like to be able to interrupt a long running simulation to look at the current state and then continue the simulation. </p>

<p>The two options I'm currently using/considering are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>dbstop commands (or (conditional) breakpoints) in the code.
Drawback is that sometimes I don't want to stop the simulation for a few hours, sometimes want to stop after only a few seconds (and I don't necessarily know that in advance) and this doesn't work well with this approach: If I set the break condition to break every 5 minutes, I can't leave matlab running for hours without interaction. If I set the condition to higher, I have to wait too long for the condition to hit. </p></li>
<li><p>include code to save the workspace every few seconds/minutes and import the workspace into a second matlab instance. Drawback is that this is a huge hassle and also doesn't necessarily allows me to resume the simulation with the state of the saved workspace then step through the code for a few iterations. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm hoping there is a better solution than either of the 2. Thanks for any advice!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I think what I'm going to do is write simple matlab function that checks an environment variable or a file on disk every iteration and calls dbstop if I set a flag in this file or env. This way I can control when (and if needed which of several) the breakpoint hits from outside matlab by editing the file. Messy, but should work. </p>

<p>This post is about testing the performances of solutions to the following problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A cell array of <code>S</code> strings formatted as numbers separated by underscores is given, e.g.:</em></p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>list_of_words = repmat({'02_04_04_52_23_14_54_672_0'},10,1);</code></p>

  <li><em>they contain only decimal digits and underscores;</em></li>
  <li><em>the number of underscores is the same;</em></li>
  <li><em>there are no two consecutive underscores.</em></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><em>Write MATLAB code that would convert the cell array of strings to a numeric matrix <code>S</code>&times;<code>M</code> of doubles <strong>(values 1000 time smaller)</strong>, where <code>S</code> is the number of strings and <code>M</code> is the number of numbers in a string.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very similar problem was posted on StackOverflow, with several solutions proposed. The original goal was improving speed performance.</p>

<h2>The code:</h2>

<p>Two of the solutions, designed for speed, seem to have wildly varying performances from one MATLAB installation to another, or even from one run to another. Also, they have really different implementation styles.</p>

<p><strong>In the dark corner</strong> you'll find a solution that goes <em>against</em> MATLAB's most sacred tenets: <code>eval</code> is evil, and loops should be avoided at all costs. However, the code tries to optimise the speed by avoiding repeated memory allocations, by using the fast ways of converting strings to numbers, and by doing in-place operations:</p>

<pre><code>%'eval_and_loops_solution.m'
function array_of_numbers = eval_and_loops_solution(list_of_words)

        n_numbers = 1 + sum(list_of_words{1}=='_');
        n_words   = numel(list_of_words);

        array_of_numbers = zeros(n_numbers, n_words);

        for k = 1:n_words
                temp = ['[', list_of_words{k}, ']'];
                temp(temp=='_') = ';';
                array_of_numbers(:,k) = eval(temp);
        end;

         %'this is a waste of memory, but is kind of required'
        array_of_numbers = transpose(array_of_numbers / 1000);

end
</code></pre>

<p><i>Note:</i> The original solution returned the result as <code>M</code>&times;<code>S</code> <code>double</code> array. The code was adapted for <code>S</code>&times;<code>M</code>; however, this adaptation consumes twice the memory. And yes, I wrote this solution.</p>

<p><strong>In the clear corner</strong> you'll find a solution true to MATLAB spirit, that avoids using loops and <code>eval</code>, favoring a single <code>sscanf</code> read of <em>all</em> the strings (which is a clever way of avoiding the overhead of calling the function <code>S</code> times):</p>

<pre><code>%'single_sscanf_solution.m'
function array_of_numbers = single_sscanf_solution(list_of_words)

        N = 1 + sum(list_of_words{1}=='_'); %'hard-coded in the original'
        lens = cellfun(@numel,list_of_words);
        tlens = sum(lens);
        idx(1,tlens)=0;
        idx(cumsum(lens(1:end-1))+1)=1;
        idx2 = (1:tlens) + cumsum(idx);

        one_str(1:max(idx2)+1)='_';
        one_str(idx2) = [list_of_words{:}];
        delim = repmat('%d_',1,N*numel(lens));
        array_of_numbers = reshape(sscanf(one_str, delim),N,[])'./1000;

end
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> This solution belongs to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3293881/divakar"">@Divakar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The referee</strong> is made up of two functions: one that generates test cases, and one that does the timig.</p>

<p>The test case generator groups in a cell array underscore-delimited strings out of 10 random integers between 1 and 9999 (for the sake of simplicity); however, an implementation should only assume that the numbers are positive or zero, and the number should fit in a <code>double</code>: </p>

<pre><code>%'referee_test_case.m'
function list_of_words = referee_test_case(n_words)

        NUM_PER_WORD  = 10;
        NUM_MAX       = 9999;

        word_format   = [repmat('%d_', 1, NUM_PER_WORD-1), '%d'];
        list_of_words = cell(n_words,1);

        fprintf('Generating %d-words test case...\n', n_words);
        for k = 1:n_words
                list_of_words{k} = sprintf(word_format, randi(NUM_MAX, [1, NUM_PER_WORD]));
        end;

end
</code></pre>

<p>The timing function takes as arguments a test case and an arbitrary number of processing function handles; it is implemented such as errors in one function should not bother the execution of the others. It uses <code>timeit</code> as recommended by @Divakar and @LuisMendo; for those who don't have this function in their default MATLAB installation, it may be downloaded from MATLAB Central / File Exchange: </p>

<pre><code>%'referee_timing.m'
function referee_timing(test_case, varargin)
        %' Specify the test case as a cell array of strings, then the function '
        %' handles that will process the test case.                            '

        %' The function uses timeit() to evaluate the performance of different '
        %' processing handles; if your MATLAB installation does not have it    '

                try
                        t = timeit(@() varargin{k}(test_case));
                        fprintf('  %s: %f[s]\n', func2str(varargin{k}), t);
                catch ME
                        fprintf('  %s: Error - %s\n', func2str(varargin{k}), ME.message);
                end;
        end;
end
</code></pre>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>As said before, the results seem to vary from one MATLAB installation to another, and even from one run to another. The problem that I propose is three-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>On your specific MATLAB installation (version + OS + HW), how well the two solutions perform compared to eachother?</li>
<li>Is it possible to improve one solution or the other in a sizable way?</li>
<li>Are there even faster MATLAB-native (e.g. no MEX or special toolboxes) solutions based on completely different ideas/functions?</li>
</ol>

<p>For point 1. (benchmarking), please create in your MATLAB path the four function files <code>eval_and_loops_solution.m</code>, <code>single_sscanf_solution.m</code>, <code>referee_test_case.m</code>, <code>referee_timig.m</code> and other functions that you might want to test (for example, the implementations proposed by answers). Use them for several numbers of words, e.g. like this script:</p>

<pre><code>%'test.m'
clc;
feature accel on;  %'tune for speed'

%'low memory stress'
referee_timing( ...
   referee_test_case(10^4), ...
   @eval_and_loops_solution, ...
   @single_sscanf_solution ... %'add here other functions'
);

%'medium memory stress'
referee_timing( ...
   referee_test_case(10^5), ...
   @eval_and_loops_solution, ...
   @single_sscanf_solution ... %'add here other functions'
);

%'high memory stress'
referee_timing( ...
   referee_test_case(10^6), ...
   @eval_and_loops_solution, ...
   @single_sscanf_solution ... %'add here other functions'
);
</code></pre>

<p>When posting the results, please specify your MATLAB version, the OS, the size of RAM and the CPU model. <strong>Please be aware that these tests might take some time for large number of words!</strong> However, running this script will not alter the content of your current workspace.</p>

<p>For points 2. or 3. you can post code that use the same in/out conventions as <code>eval_and_loops_solution.m</code> and <code>single_sscanf_solution.m</code>, along with the benchmarking that supports the claim.</p>

<h2>The bounties:</h2>

<p>I will up-vote every benchmarking answer, and I encourage everybody to do that. Is the least that one can do for people that contribute with their skills, time and processing power.</p>

<p>A +500 bounty bonus will go to the author of the fastest code, be it one of the two proposed, or a third new one that outperforms them. I really hope that this will match the general agreement. The bonus will be given in a <del>month</del> week from the original date of posting.</p>

Cross Validation Accuracy = 98.1273%

<p>To get the best C and gamma, i use this code that is available in the LIBSVM FAQ</p>

<pre><code>bestcv = 0;
for log2c = -6:10,
  for log2g = -6:3,
    cmd = ['-v 5 -c ', num2str(2^log2c), ' -g ', num2str(2^log2g)];

    end
    fprintf('(best c=%g, g=%g, rate=%g)\n',bestc, bestg, bestcv);
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Another question : Is that cross-validation accuracy after using -v option similar to that we get when we train without -v option and use that model to predict? are the two accuracy similar?</p>

<p>Another question : Cross-validation basically improves the accuracy of the model by avoiding the overfitting. So, it needs to have a model in place before it can improve. Am i right? Besides that, if i have a different model, then the cross-validation accuracy will be different? Am i right?</p>

<p>One more question: In the cross-validation accuracy, what is the value of C and gamma then?</p>

<p>The graph is something like this 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Tr3n.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then the values of C are 2 and gamma = 0.0078125. But when i retrain the model with the new parameters. The value is not the same as 99.63%. Could there be any reason?

m = [cos(angle) sin(angle) -min(xextremes); -sin(angle) cos(angle) -min(yextremes); 0 0 1];

<p>I need this <code>sub2ind</code> function or something similar, but I did not find any similar Python or Numpy function. How can I get this functionality?</p>

<p>This is an example from the <a href=""http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/ref/sub2ind.html#sub2ind_example1"" rel=""noreferrer"">matlab documentation</a> (same page as above):</p>

<pre><code>Example 1

This example converts the subscripts (2, 1, 2) for three-dimensional array A 
to a single linear index. Start by creating a 3-by-4-by-2 array A:

rng(0,'twister');   % Initialize random number generator.
A = rand(3, 4, 2)

A(:,:,1) =
    0.8147    0.9134    0.2785    0.9649
    0.9058    0.6324    0.5469    0.1576
    0.1270    0.0975    0.9575    0.9706
A(:,:,2) =
    0.9572    0.1419    0.7922    0.0357
    0.4854    0.4218    0.9595    0.8491
    0.8003    0.9157    0.6557    0.9340

Find the linear index corresponding to (2, 1, 2):

linearInd = sub2ind(size(A), 2, 1, 2)
linearInd =
    14
Make sure that these agree:

A(2, 1, 2)            A(14)
ans =                 and =
     0.4854               0.4854

<p>However, I don't want the extremely verbose syntax to do it.  It seems a bit overboard to create a new class for this when all I want to do is provide a definition for math operators on cells.</p>

<p>The question: Is a class the only way to go about it?</p>

<p>If I write a class to do this, it certainly makes it easier to write the code.  The biggest negatives I see are related to optimizations, though there's a few other things that bug me about it..</p>

<p>Any optimizations going on behind the scenes (eg, when Jacket compiles something to run on a GPU) would potentially have a harder time determining what optimizations to make.  As an example, suppose I have two cells (A,B) containing a number of matrices of appropriate dimension.  If I write code to produce a new cell:</p>

<pre><code>Z = c1*A + c2*B
</code></pre>

<p>... with scalars {c1,c2}, I can write it in such a way that Jacket (or whatever) will easily determine that it should do the calculations as:</p>

<pre><code>Z{kk} = c1*A{kk} + c2*B{kk}
</code></pre>

<p>or perhaps an even better optimization than that.  Otherwise. it may end up with something slower and/or less memory efficient, eg:</p>

<pre><code>temp1 = cellfun( @(X)( c1*X ), A );
temp2 = cellfun( @(X)( c2*X ), B );
Z     = cellfun( @plus, temp1, temp2 );
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming MATLAB or Jacket are unable to optimize it, this would end up using too much memory.</p>

<p><strong>tracker.txt</strong></p>

<pre><code>time torrent
    time peer
    time peer
    ...
time torrent
...
</code></pre>

<p>I have several files per tracker and much of the information is repeated (same information, different time).</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to analyse what I have and report statistics on things like</p>

<ul>
<li>How many torrents are at each tracker</li>
<li>How many trackers are torrents listed on</li>
<li>How many peers do torrents have</li>
<li>How many torrents to peers have</li>
</ul>

<p>The sheer quantity of data is making this hard for me to. Here's What I've tried.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>

<p>I put everything into a database; one table per entity type and tables to hold the relationships (e.g. this torrent is on this tracker).</p>

<p>Adding the information to the database was slow (and I didn't have 13GB of it when I tried this) but analysing the relationships afterwards was a no-go. Every mildly complex query took over 24 hours to complete (if at all).</p>

<p>An example query would be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT torrent) 
    FROM TorrentAtPeer, Peer 
    WHERE TorrentAtPeer.peer = Peer.id 
    GROUP BY Peer.ip;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried bumping up the memory allocations in my <code>my.cnf</code> file but it didn't seem to help. I used the <code>my-innodb-heavy-4G.cnf</code> settings file.</p>

<p>EDIT: Adding table details</p>

<p>Here's what I was using:</p>

<pre><code>Peer         Torrent                  Tracker        
-----------  -----------------------  ------------------

time (int)         time (int)

*indexed field. Navicat reports them as being of normal type and Btree method.
id - Always the primary key
</code></pre>

<p>There are no foreign keys. I was confident in my ability to only use IDs that corresponded to existing entities, adding a foreign key check seemed like a needless delay. Is this naive?</p>

<p><strong>Matlab</strong></p>

<p>This seemed like an application that was designed for some heavy lifting but I wasn't able to allocate enough memory to hold all of the data in one go.</p>

<p>I didn't have numerical data so I was using cell arrays, I moved from these to tries in an effort to reduce the footprint. I couldn't get it to work.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong></p>

<p>My most successful attempt so far. I found an implementation of Patricia Tries provided by the people at Limewire. Using this I was able to read in the data and count how many unique entities I had:</p>

<ul>
<li>13 trackers</li>
<li>1.7mil torrents</li>
<li>32mil peers</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm still finding it too hard to work out the frequencies of the number of torrents at peers. I'm attempting to do so by building tries like this:</p>

<pre><code>Trie&lt;String, Trie&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; peers = new Trie&lt;String, Trie&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;(...);
for (String line : file) {
    if (containsTorrent(line)) {
        infohash = getInfohash(line);
    }
    else if (containsPeer(line)) {
        Trie&lt;String, Object&gt; torrents = peers.get(getPeer(line));
        torrents.put(infohash, null);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>From what I've been able to do so far, if I can get this <code>peers</code> trie built then I can easily find out how many torrents are at each peer. I ran it all yesterday and when I came back I noticed that the log file wan't being written to, I <code>^Z</code> the application and <code>time</code> reported the following:</p>

<pre><code>real 565m41.479s
user 0m0.001s
sys  0m0.019s
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't look right to me, should user and sys be so low? I should mention that I've also increased the JVM's heap size to 7GB (max and start), without that I rather quickly get an out of memory error.</p>

<p>I don't mind waiting for several hours/days but it looks like the thing grinds to a halt after about 10 hours.</p>

<p>I guess my question is, how can I go about analysing this data? Are the things I've tried the right things? Are there things I'm missing? The Java solution seems to be the best so far, is there anything I can do to get it work?</p>

<p>Here is the problem. I want to compute all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real, symmetric matrix. I have implemented code in MATLAB (actually, I run it using Octave), and C++, using the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU Scientific Library</a>. I am providing my full code below for both implementations.</p>

<p>As far as I can understand, GSL comes with its own implementation of the BLAS API, (hereafter I refer to this as GSLCBLAS) and to use this library I compile using:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -O3 -lgsl -lgslcblas
</code></pre>

<p>GSL suggests <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Linking-with-an-alternative-BLAS-library.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> to use an alternative BLAS library, such as the self-optimizing <a href=""http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ATLAS</a> library, for improved performance. I am running Ubuntu 12.04, and have installed the ATLAS packages from the <a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/precise/atlas"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu repository</a>. In this case, I compile using:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -O3 -lgsl -lcblas -latlas -lm
</code></pre>

<p>For all three cases, I have performed experiments with randomly-generated matrices of sizes 100 to 1000 in steps of 100. For each size, I perform 10 eigendecompositions with different matrices, and average the time taken. The results are these:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jwM61.png"" alt=""Plot of Results""></p>

<p>The difference in performance is ridiculous. For a matrix of size 1000, Octave performs the decomposition in under a second; GSLCBLAS and ATLAS take around 25 seconds.</p>

<p>I suspect that I may be using the ATLAS library incorrectly. Any explanations are welcome; thanks in advance.</p>

<p><em>Some notes on the code:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the C++ implementation, there is no need to make the matrix
symmetric, because <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Real-Symmetric-Matrices.html#Real-Symmetric-Matrices"" rel=""noreferrer"">the function only uses the lower triangular part
of it</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>In Octave, the line <code>triu(A) + triu(A, 1)'</code> enforces the matrix to be symmetric.</p></li>
<li><p>If you wish to compile the C++ code your own Linux machine, you also need to add the flag <code>-lrt</code>, because of the <code>clock_gettime</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>Unfortunately I don't think <code>clock_gettime</code> exits on other platforms. Consider changing it to <code>gettimeofday</code>.</p></li>

I am attempting to do this because I am tired of running my code and editing my code in separate windows. </p>

<p>Following the documentation, I tried using this very reasonable seeming code below, where the '-r' flag launches MATLAB to run my file, the ""-nodesktop"" flag launches MATLAB without the big hulking Java GUI, and the ""-nosplash"" flag launches MATLAB without the unnecessary splash screen. The selector allows for Sublime to automatically use this build system on m files, and the path variable sets the path to the directory that will launch MATLAB (directory found by running ""which matlab""). </p>

<p>I am aware that I can set an preferred text editor from within the MATLAB GUI, but I am not interested in doing that. I am interested in using Sublime as a build system in addition to a text editor.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/msY1a.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The first step that I did before taking FFT of the image is to rescale it a square image of powers of two (i.e. 256 x 256).  Using FFT and fftshift in matlab gives the fast fourier transform with the intensities centered in the image.  The following image is the result of using the previous functions mentioned.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qUbKP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I was successful to remove the pattern/noise by zeroing the ""stars"" manually on the FFT image as shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqNGO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Taking the IFFT I get a much better quality of picture (not shown).</p>

<p>The question that I have is if there is an automated way of zeroing the ""stars""?  I have created an interval of where to zero the images since we don't want to remove the brightest ""star"", the DC component, nor the low values.  Such a threshold is given below:</p>

<pre><code>filter = (fLog &gt; .7*max(fLog(:)) ) | (fLog &lt; .25*max(fLog(:)) )

where fLog is the log(1+abs(Fourier image)) and .7 and .25 are the corresponding
interval percentages.
</code></pre>

<p>The output mask (which I will multiply to the Fourier Image) is found below.  Black corresponds to the value of 0 and white corresponds to 1.  Notice that the filtering of this mask removes some ""stars"" and keeps some of the DC component.  Obviously this method is not the best.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/33C56.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I was reading about doing a high pass filter, but that seems to remove all the outer values in the Fourier image.  This is based on my previous testing (I didn't include those images). </p>

<p>Is there something that you recommend to highlight the high intensity values except the DC component. Ideally I would like to get the mask to look like:</p>

<p>(λ²<strong>M</strong> + λ<strong>C</strong> + <strong>K</strong>) <strong>x</strong> = <strong>0</strong>,</p>

<p>where <strong>M</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>K</strong> are sparse matrices. Using MATLAB's <code>polyeig</code> function works, but I would like to go to larger systems and take advantage of the sparsity of my matrices. I have used a state space linearization to obtain a generalized eigenvalue problem as follows:</p>

<p>(<strong>A</strong> - λ<strong>B</strong>) <strong>z</strong> = <strong>0</strong>, </p>

<p>with</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> = [<strong>K</strong> , <strong>0</strong> ; <strong>0</strong>, -<strong>M</strong>],</p>

<p><strong>B</strong> = [-<strong>C</strong> , -<strong>M</strong> ; -<strong>M</strong>, <strong>0</strong>],</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The first eight eigenvalues are correct, but it seems as though the last two eigenvalues were not able to converge. Increasing the number of Lanczos basis vectors does not seem to improve the problem.</p>

<p>Strangely however, increasing the number of eigenvalues computed (<code>k</code>) allows more and more eigenvalues to converge: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>k =  10</code>:      Number of lambdas converged = 8</li>
<li><code>k =  20</code>:      Number of lambdas converged = 8</li>
<li><code>k =  50</code>:      Number of lambdas converged = 8</li>
<li><code>k = 100</code>:      Number of lambdas converged = 20</li>
<li><code>k = 120</code>:      Number of lambdas converged = 80</li>
<li><code>k = 150</code>:      Number of lambdas converged = 150</li>
</ul>

<p>It may also be worth mentioning that many of the eigenvalues that do not converge with lower values of <code>k</code> appear to be degenerate or at least very closely spaced.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anybody can think of an explanation for this behavior? If so, is there any way to make all of the eigenvalues converge without making <code>k</code> very large? Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>How can I use SVD to trim off low-valued eigenvalues to reconstruct a compressed image?</p>

<p><strong>Work/Attempts so far</strong></p>

<p>My code so far is:</p>

<pre><code>B=imread('images1.jpeg');   
B=rgb2gray(B);  
doubleB=double(B);  
%read the image and store it as matrix B, convert the image to a grayscale
photo and convert the matrix to a class 'double' for values 0-255  
[U,S,V]=svd(doubleB);
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to successfully decompose the image matrix with eigenvalues stored in variable S.</p>

<p>How do I truncate S (which is 167x301, class double)? Let's say of the 167 eigenvalues I want to take only the top 100 (or any n really), how do I do that and reconstruct the compressed image?</p>

<p><strong>Updated code/thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Instead of putting a bunch of code in the comments section, this is the current draft I have. I have been able to successfully create the compressed image by manually changing N, but I would like to do 2 additional things:</p>

<p>1- Show a pannel of images for various compressions (i/e, run a loop for N = 5,10,25, etc.) </p>

<p>2- Somehow calculate the difference (error) between each image and the original and graph it.</p>

<p>I am horrible with understanding loops and output, but this is what I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>B=imread('images1.jpeg');  
B=rgb2gray(B);  
doubleB=im2double(B);%  
%read the image and store it as matrix B, convert the image to a grayscale  
%photo and convert the image to a class 'double'  
[U,S,V]=svd(doubleB);   
C=S;  
for N=[5,10,25,50,100]  
C(N+1:end,:)=0;  
C(:,N+1:end)=0;  
D=U*C*V';  
%Use singular value decomposition on the image doubleB, create a new matrix  
%C (for Compression diagonal) and zero out all entries above N, (which in  
%this case is 100). Then construct a new image, D, by using the new  
%diagonal matrix C.  
imshow(D);  
error=C-D;  
end
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously there are some errors because I don't get multiple pictures or know how to ""graph"" the error matrix</p>

<h2>General Question</h2>

<p>Is there any way to get a hashset or hashmap structure in Matlab? </p>

<p>I often find myself in situations where I need to find unique entries or check membership in vectors and using commands like <code>unique()</code> or logical indexing seems to search through the vectors and is really slow for large sets of values. What is the best way to do this in Matlab?</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Say, for example, that I have a list of primes and want to check if 3 is prime:</p>

<pre><code>primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13];

if primes(primes==3)
    disp('yes!')
else
    disp('no!')
end
</code></pre>

<p>if I do this with long vectors and many times things get really slow. </p>

<h2>In other languages</h2>

<p>So basically, is there any equivalents to python's <code>set()</code> and <code>dict()</code>, or similarly Java's <code>java.util.HashSet</code> and <code>java.util.HashMap</code>, in Matlab? And if not, is there any good way of doing lookups in large vectors? </p>

<h2>Edit: reflection on the answers</h2>

<p>This is the running time i got on the suggestions in the answers.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; b = 1:1000000;
&gt;&gt; tic; for i=1:100000, any(b==i);; end; toc

&gt;&gt; tic; for i=1:100000, m(i); end; toc
Elapsed time is 2.715635 seconds

<p>The construction of the java set was quite slow as well though so depending on the problem this might be quite slow as well. Really glad about the containers.Map tip. It really destroys the other examples, and it was instant in set up too.</p>

The example deals with logistic regression and one-vs-all classification. I have a doubt about this function:</p>

%   to the classifier for label i

% Some useful variables

n = size(X, 2);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
all_theta = zeros(num_labels, n + 1);

% Add ones to the X data matrix
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the following code to train num_labels
%               logistic regression classifiers with regularization
%               parameter lambda. 
%
% Hint: theta(:) will return a column vector.
%
% Hint: You can use y == c to obtain a vector of 1's and 0's that tell use 
%       whether the ground truth is true/false for this class.
%
% Note: For this assignment, we recommend using fmincg to optimize the cost
%       function. It is okay to use a for-loop (for c = 1:num_labels) to

%
%       fmincg works similarly to fminunc, but is more efficient when we
%       are dealing with large number of parameters.
%
% Example Code for fmincg:
%
%     % Set Initial theta
%     initial_theta = zeros(n + 1, 1);
%     
%     % Set options for fminunc
%     options = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 50);
% 
%     % Run fmincg to obtain the optimal theta
%     % This function will return theta and the cost 
%     [theta] = ...

<li>The algorithm needs to be reasonable in execution time because this task may be repeated up to 200 times.</li>
<li>We don't necessarly search for the optimal solution, a near optimal solution would suffice.</li>
<li>We need to keep track of the combined individuals (as in the example above)</li>

The prototype of recursive functions obviously is the factorial function. The problem is that it is difficult to make a case distinction <em>within</em> the anonymous functions. What I managed to do so far is following:</p>

<p>What is not very satisfactory is that you still cannot use this function when directly assigning, <code>a=f(3)</code> still produces an error, since <code>eval</code> does not get a value.</p>

<p>This is difficult to compare to a full matrix without knowing more details.</p>

<p>Scipy's sparse matrix library explains pros and cons of each sparse format. For example for the <a href=""https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.csc_matrix""><code>csc_matrix</code></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advantages of the CSC format</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>efficient arithmetic operations CSC + CSC, CSC * CSC, etc. </li>
  <li>efficient column slicing </li>
  <li>fast matrix vector products (CSR, BSR may be faster)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Disadvantages of the CSC format </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>slow row slicing operations (consider CSR) </li>
  <li>changes to the sparsity structure are expensive (consider LIL or DOK)</li>
  </ul>

<pre><code>data(1, :) = [1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1];
</code></pre>

<p>I need to select sets of n rows, such that the <strong>mean of the absolute sums of the columns</strong> is minimized (as close to zero as possible). So, in this toy example, where n=2: </p>

<pre><code>[ 1  1  1  1]
[-1 -1 -1 -1]
[-1  1 -1  1]
</code></pre>

<p>I would select rows 1 and 2, as they sum to [0 0 0 0] (mean 0), which is the minimum possible when n=2.</p>

<hr>

<p>I tried the method suggested below (of finding complementary pairs), but for my dataset, this can only form a balanced subset of 23k rows. So, I need an approximation which generates a subset of size n rows, but with the minimum means of absolute sums of the columns. </p>

<p>The best approach I have found so far is as follows: pick a starting subset, iteratively add each row from the remainder to the base, and keep it if it improves the mean of the absolute sums of the columns. This is very crude and I am sure there are better ways. It is also prone to getting stuck at false minima, so a contingency needs to be added: </p>

<pre><code>shuffle = randperm(size(data));
data_shuffled = data(shuffle, :);

base = data_shuffled(1:30000, :);
pool = data_shuffled(30001:end, :);

best_mean = mean(abs(sum(base, 1)));
best_matrix = base;
n = 100000;

for k = 1:20

    for i = 1:size(pool, 1)
        temp = pool (i, :);

        if(~isnan(temp(1)))
            temp_sum = sum(temp, 1);
            new_sum = temp_sum + sum(best, 1);
            temp_mean = mean(abs(new_sum));

            if(temp_mean &lt; best_mean)
                best_mean = temp_mean;
                best_matrix = vertcat(best_matrix, temp);
                pool(i, :) = NaN(1, 10);            
            end
        end
    end

    if(size(best_matrix, 1) &gt; n)
        return
    end

end
</code></pre>

<p>This achieves a mean of the absolute sums of the columns of ~17,000, which is not too bad. Repeating with different seeds will probably improve it a bit. </p>

<p>Ideally, rather than just adding the new element to the end of best_matrix, I would <strong>swap it</strong> with some element, so as to achieve the best improvement.   </p>

Here is how I want to do it:</p>

<pre><code>num_of_iters = 10;
K = 200;
for iter = 1:num_of_iters
    parfor j = 1:K
        R = make_random_R(iter,j,.....);

    end
end

<p>What I'm worried about is the parfor loop, I need to be able to reproduce the random matrices no matter what the order of indices in the parfor is. So I decided to use a MATLAB stream for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save the global stream</li>
<li>Create a new stream, set the seed and appropriate substream (which depends on iter and j)</li>
<li>Do the math</li>
<li>Put back the global stream</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my code (the variables n,p,R_type control how the random matrices are made, but they are not important, and K is the same variable as the one from above, I need it in the line <code>substream_id = (iter - 1) * K + j;</code>) : </p>

<pre><code>function [R] = make_random_R(iter,j,n,K,p,R_type)

% R_type: 'posneg' or 'normdist'
% 1 &lt;= iter &lt;= 100
% 1 &lt;= j &lt;= K
% K: Number of classifiers
% n: Number of observations

assert(strcmp(R_type,'posneg') || strcmp(R_type,'normdist'),'R_type must be posneg or normdist');
assert(iter &gt;= 1,'Error: iter &gt;= 1 not satisfied');
assert((1 &lt;= j) &amp;&amp; (j &lt;= K),'Error: 1 &lt;= j &lt;= K not satisfied');
assert(K &gt; 0,'Error: K &gt; 0 not satisfied');

globalStream = RandStream.getGlobalStream;
globalState =  globalStream.State;

stream=RandStream('mlfg6331_64','Seed',1);
substream_id = (iter - 1) * K + j;
stream.Substream = substream_id;
RandStream.setGlobalStream(stream);

switch R_type
    case 'posneg'        
        q0=ceil(2*log(n)/0.25^2)+1;
        if (q0 &lt; p)
            q = q0;
        else
            q = ceil(p/2);
        end
        R = randi([0 1],p,q);
        R(R == 0) = -1;
    case 'normdist'        
        q = 2*ceil(log2(p));
        R = normrnd(0,1,[p,q]);    
end
RandStream.setGlobalStream(globalStream);
globalStream.State = globalState;
end

<p>I wish to solve a general system of linear equations A*x=b. The m-by-m matrix is sparse, real, square, somewhat poorly-conditioned, non-symmetric, but it is singular (rank(A)==m-1) because <code>x</code> is known only up to an additive constant. </p>

<p>I can create the matrix A by specifying its nonzero entries in three vectors (<code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>v</code>) such that <code>A(i(k),j(k)) = v(k)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>A = sparse( i, j, v, m, m );
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Equation</h3>

<p>I can solve this original equation as follows:</p>

<pre><code>x = A \ b;
</code></pre>

<p>If I want a unique solution, I can impose a constraint (say, x(4) == 3.14159) after calculating the non-unique solution:</p>

<pre><code>x = x - x(4) + 3.14159;
</code></pre>

<h3>Modified Equation</h3>

<p>I can make a new, full-rank matrix <code>C</code> by adding an additional uniqueness constraint, as follows: </p>

<pre><code>% Add the constraint x(4) == 3.14159
extraRow = zeros(1,m);
extraRow(4) = 1.0;
C = [A; extraRow];    % Add to the matrix A
d = [b; 3.14159];     % Add to the RHS vector, b

% Solve C*y = d for y
y = C \ d;
</code></pre>

<h1>Numerics</h1>

<p>I understand that when I solve these equations via either <code>x = A \ b</code> or <code>y = C \ b</code>, MATLAB interprets the <code>\</code> as the <code>mldivide()</code> command (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a>), which runs some tests on the matrix and figures out an optimal algorithm to solve the routine (see link for details). </p>

<p>These details are made verbose at runtime by setting MATLAB's sparse matrix solving parameters via <code>spparms('spumoni',2)</code></p>

<p>When I compute <code>x</code> and/or <code>y</code>, I notice the following: </p>

<li>MATLAB uses LU decomposition via UMFPACK V5.4.0 for the square, m-by-m original equation. </li>
<li>MATLAB uses QR decomposition via SuiteSparseQR 1.1.0 for the m-by-(m+1) modified equation. </li>
</ul>

<p>Both UMFPACK and SuiteSparseQR are part of the SuiteSparse software package (<a href=""http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a>). </p>

<p>(Somewhat unexpectedly, solving the modified equation gives more error than the original equation. While significant, this error is still at an acceptably-low threshold.)</p>

<h1>My Problem</h1>

<p>Now that I can solve this problem in MATLAB, I wish to do so in Fortran. Unfortunately, MATLAB's <code>mldivide()</code> command is a black-box in that I cannot see how it sets up or calls the <em>SuiteSparse</em> routines. </p>

<p><strong>Given that I have the three sparse vectors in Fortran (90+) as shown below, how can I solve the problem using <em>SuiteSparse</em>?</strong> </p>

<p>Alternatively, does anyone know of any F90 wrapper routines that interface to UMFPACK to make this easier? </p>

<p>I'm more than happy if anyone can help with this--either with the Original Equation or with the Modified Equation. (If you help with one, I could probably get the other.) </p>

<pre><code>subroutine solveSparseMatrixEqnViaSuiteSparse( m, n, nnz, i, j, v, x )

    real*8,  dimension(1:n), intent(out)  :: x     ! solution vector

    ! I have no idea what to do next! 

end function solveSparseMatrixEqnViaSuiteSparse
</code></pre>

<p>What confuse me are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is MATLAB doing behind the scenes to set up the call to SuiteSparse? (It does not appear to be documented....)</li>
<li>What needs to be done to call SuiteSparse from within Fortran? (I could probably figure most out from <a href=""https://github.com/PetterS/SuiteSparse/blob/master/UMFPACK/Demo/umf4zhb.f"" rel=""noreferrer"">this demo</a>, given enough time, but it is odd that it calls routines several times....)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Although I'm asking this question with a particular problem in mind (who isn't!?), I believe this is general enough to be useful to others as well. </p>

Let's look at the following example, which is somehow striking, involving the function <strong>digitize</strong> (which I plan to use for synchronizing timestamps):</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import time
scale=np.arange(1,1e+6+1)
y=np.arange(1,1e+6+1,10)

<p>The result is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time passed is 55.91 seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's now try the same example <strong>Matlab</strong> using the equivalent function <strong>histc</strong></p>

<pre><code>scale=[1:1e+6];
y=[1:10:1e+6];
tic
[N,bin]=histc(scale,y);
t=toc;
display(['Time passed is ',num2str(t), ' seconds'])
</code></pre>

<p>The result is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time passed is 0.10237 seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's <strong>560 times faster!</strong></p>

<p>As I'm learning to extend Python with C++, I implemented my own version of digitize (using boost libraries for the extension):</p>

<pre><code>import analysis # my C++ module implementing digitize
t1=time.time()
ind2=analysis.digitize(scale,y)
t2=time.time()
print 'Time passed is %2.2f seconds' %(t2-t1)
np.all(ind==ind2) #ok
</code></pre>

<p>The result is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time passed is 0.02 seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a bit of cheating as my version of digitize assumes inputs are all monotonic, this might explain why it is even faster than Matlab. However, sorting an array of size 1e+6 takes 0.16 seconds (with numpy.sort), making therefore the performance of my function <em>worse</em> (by a factor of approx 1.6) compared to the Matlab function <em>histc</em>.</p>

<p>So the questions are:</p>

<li>Why is numpy.digitize so slow? Is this function not supposed to be written in compiled and optimized code?</li>
<li>Why is my own version of digitize much faster than numpy.digitize, but still slower than Matlab (I am quite confident I use the fastest algorithm possible, given that I assume inputs are already sorted)?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am using Fedora 16 and I recently installed ATLAS and LAPACK libraries (but there has been so change in performance). Should I perhaps rebuild numpy? I am not sure if my installation of numpy uses the appropriate libraries to gain maximum speed, perhaps Matlab is using better libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Based on the answers so far, I would like to stress that the Matlab function <em>histc</em> is <strong>not equivalent</strong> to <em>numpy.histogram</em> if someone (like me in this case) does not care about the histogram. I need the second output of hisc, which is a mapping from input values to the index of the provided input bins. Such an output is provided by the numpy functions <em>digitize</em> and <em>searchsorted</em>. As one of the answers says, <em>searchsorted</em> is much faster than <em>digitize</em>. However, searchsorted is <em>still slower than Matlab by a factor 2</em>:</p>

<pre><code>t1=time.time()
ind3=np.searchsorted(y,scale,""right"")
t2=time.time()
print 'Time passed is %2.2f seconds' %(t2-t1)

np.all(ind==ind3) #ok
</code></pre>

<p>The result is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time passed is 0.21 seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the questions are now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the sense of having <em>numpy.digitize</em> if there is an equivalent function <em>numpy.searchsorted</em> which is <strong>280 times faster</strong>?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is the Matlab function <em>histc</em> (which also provides the output of <em>numpy.searchsorted</em>) <strong>2 times faster</strong> than <em>numpy.searchsorted</em>?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How to detect the black dots in the following images? (I paste only one test image to make the question look compact. More images can be found <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y1nwwsy0o96bkyf/AADq8iMo1YJ2XJbgMkSAlmIfa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">→here←</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6abIc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>My long question</h2>

<p>As shown above, the background color is roughly blue, and the dots color is ""black"". If pick one black pixel and measure its color in RGB, the value can be <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kPTwy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> (0, 44, 65) or <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tqUzJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> (14, 69, 89).... Therefore, we cannot set a range to tell the pixel is part of the black dot or the background.</p>

<p>I test 10 images of different colors, but I hope I can find a method to detect the black dots from more complicated background which may be made up of three or more colors, as long as human eyes can identify the black dots easily. Some extremely small or blur dots can be omitted.</p>

<h2>Previous work</h2>

<p>Last month, I have asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23364703/extract-black-objects-from-color-background"">a similar question</a> at stackoverflow, but have not got a perfect solution, some excellent answers though. Find more details about my work if you are interested.</p>

<p>Here are the methods I have tried:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Converting to grayscale or the brightness of image.</strong> The difficulty is that I can not find an adaptive threshold to do binarization. Obviously, turning a color image to grayscale or using the brightness (HSV) will lose much useful information. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Otsu algorithm</a> which calculates adaptive threshold can not work either.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculating RGB histogram</strong>. In my last question, <em>natan</em>'s method is to estimate the black color by histogram. It is time-saving, but the adaptive threshold is also a problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clustering</strong>. I have tried <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">k-means clustering</a> and found it quite effective for the background that only has one color. The shortage (see my own answer) is I need to set the number of clustering center in advance but I don't know how the background will be. What's more, it is too <strong>slow</strong>! My application is for real time capturing on iPhone and now it can process 7~8 frames per second using k-means (20 FPS is good I think).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I think not only similar colors but also adjacent pixels should be ""clustered"" or ""merged"" in order to extract the black dots. Please guide me a proper way to solve my problem. Any advice or algorithm will be appreciated. There is no free lunch but I hope a better trade-off between cost and accuracy.</p>

<pre><code>arglist = [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4];

parfor ii = 1:size(arglist, 2)
    myfun(arglist(ii));
end
</code></pre>

<p>Everything worked just fine, except for one thing: the progress printing. Since each simulation takes a lot of time, I usually print progress using something like</p>

<pre><code>prevlength = 0;
for ii = 1:tot_iter

    % Some calculations here

    msg = sprintf('Working on %d of %d, %.2f percent done', ii, tot_iter, ii/tot_iter);
    fprintf(repmat('\b', 1, prevlength))
    fprintf(msg);
    prevlength = numel(msg);
end
</code></pre>

<p>but, as could be expected, when doing this inside a <code>parfor</code> loop, you get chaos. </p>

<p>I have googled a lot in search of a solution and have found a bunch of ""parfor progress printers"" like <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31673-parfor-progress-monitor-v2"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a>. However, all of them print the progress of the entire <code>parfor</code> loop instead of showing how far each of the individual iterations have come. Since I only have about 4-8 iterations in the <code>parfor</code> loop, but each iteration takes about an hour, this approach isn't very helpful to me.</p>

<p>The ideal solution for me would be something that looks like this</p>

<pre><code>Working on 127 of 10000, 1.27 percent done
Working on 259 of 10000, 2.59 percent done
Working on 3895 of 10000, 38.95 percent done
Working on 1347 of 10000, 13.47 percent done
</code></pre>

<p>that is, each simulation gets one line showing how far it has run. I'm not sure though if this is possible at all, I can at least not imagine any way to do this.</p>

<p>Another way would be to do something like this</p>

<pre><code>Sim 1: 1.27%    Sim 2: 2.59%    Sim 3: 38.95%   Sim 4: 13.47%
</code></pre>

<p>that is, show all the progresses on the same line. To do this, you would need to keep track of what position on the line each simulation is to write on and write there, without erasing the other progresses. I can't figure out how this would be done, is this possible to do?</p>

<p>If there is some other solution to my problem (showing the progress of each individual iteration) that I haven't thought of, I'd be happy to hear about it.</p>

<p>So the following command will generate the same results as in <code>C2</code> without throwing any errors:</p>

<pre><code>C3 = cellfun(@(x) {x + 1}, C1);

<p>In terms of code layout I prefer this approach since it is more compact and less verbose than the former, but I am not sure if this is always safe.</p>

<p>I have a picture that is taken from a swinging vehicle. For simplicity I have converted it into a black and white image. An example is shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLHYz.png"" alt=""Figure 1""></p>

<p>The image shows the high intensity returns and has a pattern in it that is found it all of the valid images is circled in red. This image can be taken from multiple angles depending on the rotation of the vehicle. Another example is here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3sUgo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The intention here is to attempt to identify the picture cells in which this pattern exists. </p>

<p><strong>CURRENT APPROACHES</strong></p>

<p>I have tried a couple of methods so far, I am using Matlab to test but will eventually be implementing in c++. It is desirable for the algorithm to be time efficient, however, I am interested in any suggestions. </p>

<p><strong><em>SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) Feature Recognition</em></strong></p>

<p>I tried the default matlab implementation of SURF to attempt to find features. Matlab SURF is able to identify features in 2 examples (not the same as above) however, it is not able to identify common ones:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtrnH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I know that the points are different but the pattern is still somewhat identifiable. I have tried on multiple sets of pictures and there are almost never common points. From reading about SURF it seems like it is not robust to skewed images anyway. 
<strong><em>Perhaps some recommendations on pre-processing here?</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong><em>Template Matching</em></strong></p>

<p>So template matching was tried but is definitely not ideal for the application because it is not robust to scale  or skew change. I am open to pre-processing ideas to fix the skew. This could be quite easy, some discussion on extra information on the picture is provided further down.</p>

<p>For now lets investigate template matching: Say we have the following two images as the template and the current image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1C8z.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The template is chosen from one of the most forward facing images. And using it on a very similar image we can match the position:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0R2i.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But then (and somewhat obviously) if we change the picture to a different angle it won't work. Of course we expect this because the template no-longer looks like the pattern in the image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lL3zf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So we obviously need some pre-processing work here as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hough Lines and RANSAC</em></strong></p>

<p>Hough lines and RANSAC might be able to identify the lines for us but then how do we get the pattern position?</p>

<p><strong><em>Other that I don't know about yet</em></strong></p>

<p>I am pretty new to the image processing scene so i would love to hear about any other techniques that would suit this simple yet difficult image rec problem.</p>

<p><strong>The sensor and how it will help pre-processing</strong></p>

<p>The sensor is a 3d laser, it has been turned into an image for this experiment but still retains its distance information. If we plot with distance scaled from 0 - 255 we get the following image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsEEx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Where lighter is further away. This could definitely help us to align the image, <strong><em>some thoughts on the best way?</em></strong>. So far I have thought of things like calculating the normal of the cells that are not 0, we could also do some sort of gradient descent or least squares fitting such that the difference in the distance is 0, that could align the image so that it is always straight. The problem with that is that the solid white stripe is further away? Maybe we could segment that out? We are sort of building algorithms on our algorithms then so we need to be careful so this doesn't become a monster. </p>

I also learned recently about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_disk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>RAM disks</strong></a> (see <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/34388/whats-the-best-ramdisk-for-windows"">here</a> and <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/175861/ramdisk-ubuntu-10-04"">here</a> for some implementation examples), and thought that they might facilitate the task of sharing large datasets between Matlab and R (or similar computational environments) further. This leads me to the following questions: </p>

<p>Assumming that the data fits in the machines' memory in Matlab's or R's native data containers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are any of the solutions listed so
far a better fit for RAM disks? </p></li>
<li><p>Are there any additional
considerations to be taken into
account when dealing with RAM disks
instead of with secundary-storage
solutions?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Unless Matlab does some clever optimisations, before truncating <code>Z</code>, this code actually <em>creates</em> an array (of type double!) <code>364000000:628000000</code>.  I don't need this array, so I can do instead:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Z = Z(1:363999999);

<p>In this case, the second example works, and is fine for my purpose.  But <em>why</em> does it work?  If <code>Z(364000000:end) = 0</code> fails due to the memory needed for the intermediate array <code>364000000:628000000</code>, then why does not <code>Z = Z(1:363999999)</code> fail due to the memory needed for the intermediate array <code>1:363999999</code>, that is <em>larger</em>?  Of course, I don't <em>need</em> this intermediate array, and would be happy with either a solution that truncates my array without having any intermediate array, or, failing that, if Matlab optimises a particular method.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any way to truncate an array without creating an intermediate indexing array?</li>

&gt;&gt; test(2)=1;
&gt;&gt; tic;any(test);toc
Elapsed time is 0.000021 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out that this happens because the variable is not really on RAM until its completely filled with information, therefore the first test takes longer because it needs to allocate it. The way I checked this was by looking at the memory used in the Windows Task Manager. </p>

<p>While this may make some sense (do not initialize until its needed), what confused me a bit more is the following test, where the variable is filled in a for loop and at some point the execution is stopped. </p>

<pre><code>test=zeros(1e7,1);

for ii=1:1e7
    test(ii)=1;
    if ii==1e7/2
        pause
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>When checking the memory used by MATLAB, I could see how when stopped, it was using only 50% of <code>test</code> needed memory (if it was full). This can be reproduced with different % of memory quite solidly. </p>

<p>Interestingly the following does not allocate the entire matrix either.</p>

<pre><code>test=zeros(1e7,1);
test(end)=1;
</code></pre>

<p>I know that MATLAB is not dynamically allocating and increasing the size of <code>test</code> in the loop, as that would make the end iterations very slow (due to the high memcopys that would need) and it would also allocate the entire array in this last test I proposed. So my question is:</p>

<p><strong>What is going on?</strong></p>

<p>Someone suggested that this can be related to virtual-memory vs physical-memory, and related to how the OS sees memory. Not sure how that links to the first test proposed here though. Any further explanation would be ideal.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> following <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14057698/1714410"">Jonas' answer</a>, a brief summary:</p>

<p>Matlab has two types of classes: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/user-defined-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">value classes (the default)</a> and <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/handle-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">handle classes (derived from <code>handle</code> super class)</a>. Value classes tends to provide better performance, however, they do not have a destructor functionality.</p>

<p><code>handle</code> classes do have a destructor function: <code>delete</code> that is called when the class is destroyed. See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7236649/matlab-run-object-destructor-when-using-clear"">this question</a> from more details on <code>handle</code> class destructors.</p>

<p>If one wishes to have a destructor-like functionality for value classes, Jona's answer proposes a method utilizing <code>onCleanup</code> functionality.</p>

I've tested my python installation of autobahn and twisted using the following.</p>

<h2>Working Example</h2>

<h3>Matlab Code</h3>

<p>Sample driver code that uses the <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files-in-matlab-octave"">JSONlab</a> toolbox to convert Matlab data to JSON form and then I <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25656-compression-routines"">compress</a> and <a href=""https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base64.html"">Base64</a> encode the data. Since I haven't gotten RPC to work I'm using the command-line where I need compression and Base64 encoding to avoid line-length and shell escaping issues.</p>

<pre><code>clear all
close all

python = '/usr/local/bin/python'
bc = '/Users/palmerc/broadcast_client.py'
i = uint32(1)

encoder = org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64
while true
    tic;
    packet = rand(100, 100);
    json_packet = uint8(savejson('', packet));
    compressed = CompressLib.compress(json_packet);
    b64 = char(encoder.encode(compressed));
    message = sprintf('%s %s %s', python, bc, b64);
    status = system(message);

    i = i + 1;
    toc;
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Broadcast Client Code</h3>

<p>The client code has two ways of being called. You can pass your message through the command-line or create an instance of BroadcastClient and call sendMessage.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from twisted.internet import reactor
from txjsonrpc.web.jsonrpc import Proxy


class BroadcastClient():

    def __init__(self, server=None):
        self.proxy = Proxy(server)

    def errorMessage(self, value):
        print 'Error ', value

    def sendMessage(self, message):
        rc = self.proxy.callRemote('broadcastMessage', message).addCallback(lambda _: reactor.stop())
        rc.addErrback(self.errorMessage)


def main(cli_arguments):
    if len(cli_arguments) &gt; 1:
        message = cli_arguments[1]
        broadcastClient = BroadcastClient('http://127.0.0.1:7080/')
        broadcastClient.sendMessage(message)
        reactor.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(sys.argv)
</code></pre>

<h3>Broadcast Server Code</h3>

<p>The server provides an RPC client on 7080, a web client on 8080, and a WebSocket on 9080 using TXJSONRPC, Twisted, and Autobahn. The <a href=""https://gist.github.com/palmerc/074e8f1283a74dc66c99"">Autobahn Web Client</a> is useful for debugging and should be placed in the same directory as the server code.</p>

<h2>The Problem - Failed Attempts</h2>

<p>First a note, If you have trouble getting python working from Matlab you need to make sure you're pointing at the correct version of Python on your system using the <code>pyversion</code> command and you can correct it using <code>pyversion('/path/to/python')</code></p>

<h3>Matlab can't run reactor</h3>

<pre><code>clear all
close all

i = uint32(1)

while true
    tic;
    packet = rand(100, 100);
    json_packet = uint8(savejson('', packet));
    compressed = CompressLib.compress(json_packet);
    b64 = char(encoder.encode(compressed));
    bc.sendMessage(py.str(b64.'));
    py.twisted.internet.reactor.run % This won't work.

    i = i + 1;
    toc;
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Matlab POST</h3>

<p>Another attempt involved using Matlab's <code>webwrite</code> to POST to the server. Turns out <code>webwrite</code> will convert data to JSON simply by passing the correct <code>weboptions</code>.</p>

<pre><code>options = weboptions('MediaType', 'application/json');
data = struct('Matrix', rand(100, 100));
webwrite(server, data, options);
</code></pre>

<p>This worked, but turns out to be slow (~0.1 seconds) per message. I should mention that the matrix is not the real data I'm sending, the real data serializes to about 280000 bytes per message, but this provides a reasonable approximation.</p>

<p>How can I call <code>bc.sendMessage</code> so that it correctly manages to get reactor to run or solve this issue in another, faster way? </p>

I narrowed the problem down to a single type of computation: assigning to multiple struct properties.</p>

<p>For example, even self assignment of this form eventually causes a seg fault when executed several thousand times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[my_class_instance.my_struct_vector.my_property] = my_class_instance.my_struct_vector.my_property;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I initially assumed this must be a memory leak of some sort, so tried printing out java's free memory after every iteration, but this remained fairly constant.</p>

<p>So yeah, completely at a loss now as to why this breaks :-/</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: the following changes fixes the seg faulting:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>temp = [my_class_instance.my_struct_vector];</p>
  
  <p>[temp.my_property] = temp.my_property;</p>
  
  <p>[my_class_instance.my_struct_vector] = temp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The question is now why this would fix anything. Something about repeated accessing a handle class rather than a struct list perhaps?</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2: THE PLOT THICKENS</strong></p>

<p>I've finally replicated the problem and the work around using a dummy program simple enough to post here:</p>

<p>a simple class:</p>

<pre><code>classdef test_class
    properties
        test_prop
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And a program that makes a bunch of vector assignments with the class, and will always crash.</p>

<pre><code>test_instance = test_class();
test_instance.test_prop = struct('test_field',{1 1});
for i=1:10000

    [test_instance.test_prop.test_field] = test_instance.test_prop.test_field;
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3: THE PLOT THINS</strong></p>

<p>Turns out I found a bug. According to Matlab tech support, repeated vector assignment of class properties simply won't work in R2011a (and presumably in earlier version). He told me it works fine in R2012a, and then mentioned the same workaround I discovered: use a temporary variable.</p>

<p><strong>So yeah...</strong></p>

<p>pretty sure this question ends with that support ticket, but if any daring individuals want to take a shot as to WHY this bug exists at all, I'd definitely still be interested in such an answer. (learning is fun!)</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this difference?  What exactly is the architecture of the BLAS implementation?  I see it is using Fortran, but what is happening at the CPU level?  What algorithm is it using?  How is it using the CPU caches?  What x86-64 machine instructions does it call?  (Is it using advanced CPU features like AVX?)  Where does it get this extra speed from?</p>

<p>Which key optimizations to the C++ algorithm could get it on par with the BLAS version?</p>

<p>It is ATLAS 3.8.4</p>

<p>Here are the optimizations I later implemented:</p>

<p>Using a tiled approach where I preload 64x64 blocks of X, Y and Z into separate arrays.</p>

<p>Changing the calculation of each block so that the inner loop looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (size_t tcol = 0; tcol &lt; block_width; tcol++)
    bufz[trow][tcol] += B * bufy[tk][tcol];
</code></pre>

<p>This allows GCC to autovectorize to SIMD instructions and also allows for instruction level parallelism (I think).</p>

<p>Turning on <code>march=corei7-avx</code>.  This gains 30% extra speed but is cheating because I think the BLAS library is prebuilt.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

<ol>
<li>Pick 2 mat files</li>
<li>Find the differences</li>
<li>Save them properly</li>
</ol>

<p>The closest I have come is <code>visdiff</code>. As long as I stay within matlab, it will allow me to browse the differences, but when I save the result it only shows me the top level.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified example of what my files typically look like:</p>

<pre><code>a = 6;
b.c.d = 7;
b.c.e = 'x';
save f1
f = a;
clear a
b.c.e = 'y';
save f2
visdiff('f1.mat','f2.mat')

<p>If I click here on <code>b</code>, I can find the difference. However if I run this and use 'file>save', I am not able to click on <code>b</code>. Thus I still don't know what has been changed.</p>

<p>Note: I don't have Simulink</p>

In my experience however, the true bottleneck in Matlab is data plotting. Creating handles is extremely expensive and even if you only update handle data (e.g., XData, YData, ZData), this might take ages. Even worse, since Matlab is a single threaded program, it is impossible to update multiple plots at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore my question</strong>: <em>Is it possible to write a Matlab GUI and call C++ (or some other parallelizable code) which would take care of the plotting / visualization?</em> I'm looking for a cross-platform solution that will work on Windows, Mac and Linux, but any solution that get's me started on either OS is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/matplotpp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ library</a> that seems to use Matlab's <code>plot()</code> syntax but I'm not sure whether this would speed things up, since I'm afraid that if I plot into Matlab's <code>figure()</code> window, things might get slowed down again.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any comments and feedback from people who have dealt with this kind of situation before! </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> obviously, I've already profiled my code and the bottleneck is the plotting (dozen of panels with lots of data).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> for you to get the bounty, I need a real life, minimal working example on how to do this - suggestive answers won't help me.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong> regarding the data to plot: in a most simplistic case, think about 20 line plots, that need to be updated each second with something like 1000000 data points. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT4:</strong> I know that this is a huge amount of points to plot but I never said that the problem was easy. I can not just leave out certain data points, because there's no way of assessing what points are important, before actually plotting them (data is sampled a sub-ms time resolution). As a matter of fact, my data is acquired using a commercial data acquisition system which comes with a data viewer (written in c++). This program has no problem visualizing up to 60 line plots with even more than 1000000 data points. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT5:</strong> I don't like where the current discussion is going. I'm aware that sub-sampling my data might speeds up things - however, this is not the question. The question here is how to get a c / c++ / python / java interface to work with matlab in order hopefully speed up plotting by talking directly to the hardware (or using any other trick / way)</p>

<pre><code>function [things] = myfunc(data)
  [stuff] = mysubfunc(data)

<p>I want to perform unit testing on subfunc itself. This is, AFAIK, impossible because I cannot call it from any external function. </p>

<p>I'm currently using Matlab xUnit by Steve Eddins and cannot get around this issue. The easy solution -- splitting subfunc out to its own M-file -- is not acceptable in practice because I will have numerous small functions I want to test and don't want to pollute my filesystem with a separate M-file for each one. What can I do to write and perform easy unit tests without making new files for each function I want to test?</p>

<p>Here is the solution I thought could work out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use a key mapping in vim that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Put in the clipboard something like: <code>run('path-to-file')</code> or <code>cd('folder');run('filename')</code>.</li>
<li>(b) Call a shell command that gives the focus to the Matlab GUI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>At this point, I should be in Matlab command window, so I just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd>, and the content of the clipboard should be pasted. (Even though I’m on Linux, I use Matlab with Windows keybindings.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 1(a):</strong>
The following will put the <code>run('filename')</code> command to the clipboard, and Matlab will paste it when <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd> is pressed:</p>
<pre><code>let @+=&quot;run(\'&quot;.expand(&quot;%:p&quot;).&quot;')&quot;

<p>The following two commands would work with the Linux middle button pasting, but that is not what I want, as I want to avoid the mouse in this step:</p>

execute '!echo &quot;' . &quot;run(\'&quot;.expand(&quot;%:p&quot;).&quot;\')&quot; . '&quot;| xclip'  
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 1(b):</strong> To give the focus to the Matlab window, I use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>wmctrl -a MATLAB &amp;

<p>This works well, but it might also raise a browser window, if it happens to have a page open with the word Matlab in its title (like the one you are reading at the moment).</p>

<p>My bad, I was using <code>xclip</code> where I should have used <code>xclip -selection c</code>. See my reply below.</p>

I understand that MATLAB automatically assigns data types to variables (to the liking of some and the dismay of others), but I would like to know if there is an option of ""strict data typing"" in MATLAB, or something of the sort, especially for input arguments for a user-defined function.</p>

<p>I found a helpful explanation of MATLAB's ""fundamental classes"" (data types) at these two webpages:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/fundamental-matlab-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/fundamental-matlab-classes.html</a>
<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/data-types_data-types.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/data-types_data-types.html</a></p>

<p>However, I have been unable to find an answer to the question of strict data typing, particularly for function input arguments. I thought it would be a pretty basic question that already had been answered in numerous places, but after extensive searching I have not yet found a conclusive answer. For now, I have been manually checking the data type using the <code>is[TYPE]()</code> functions and displaying an error message if it does not comply, though this seems sloppy and I wish I could just get MATLAB to enforce it for me.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a function in which I would like to specify the input argument data type. It resides in a file called <code>strict_data_type_test.m</code> in MATLAB's current path. In this function, I would like to force the variable <code>yes_or_no</code> to be of MATLAB's <code>logical</code> data type. I know I can use the <code>islogical()</code> function to manually check, but my question is if it is possible to have MATLAB enforce it for me. I also know that any non-zero double evaluates to true and a zero evaluates to false, but I want to force the user to send a <code>logical</code> to make sure the wrong argument was not sent in by accident, for example. Here is the example function:</p>

<pre><code>function y = strict_data_type_test( x, yes_or_no )

    % manual data type check can go here, but manual check is not desirable

    if (yes_or_no)
        y = 2 .* x;
    else
        y = -5 .* x;
    end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the data type before the input argument variable name (like in most programming languages) treats the data type text as another variable name instead of a data type identifier. From that it would seem that strict data typing is not possible in MATLAB by any means, but maybe one of you many gurus knows a useful trick, feature, or syntax that I have not been able to find.</p>

<li>be well documented</li>
<li>(have commercial support) </li>
<li>have already made Matlab wrappers </li>
<li>very robust</li>

After a couple failed attempts I went to the Mathworks file exchange site and found an open source program which fits my needs courtesy of <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31726-data-density-plot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Malcolm Mclean</a>. With a test matrix his function produces something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/abLHc.jpg"" alt=""Vector density in Stereographic Projection""> </p>

<p>And while this is almost exactly what I wanted, his code relies on a triply nested for-loop. On my workstation a test data matrix of size 25000x2 took 65 seconds in this section of code. This is unacceptable since I will be scaling up to a data matrices of size 500000x2 in my project.</p>

<p>So far I've been able to vectorize the innermost loop (which was the longest/worst loop), but I would like to continue and be rid of the loops entirely if possible. Here is Malcolm's original code that I need to vectorize:</p>

<pre><code>dmap = zeros(height, width); % height, width: scalar with default value = 32
for ii = 0: height - 1          % 32 iterations of this loop
    yi = limits(3) + ii * deltay + deltay/2; % limits(3) &amp; deltay: scalars
    for jj = 0 : width - 1      % 32 iterations of this loop
        xi = limits(1) + jj * deltax + deltax/2; % limits(1) &amp; deltax: scalars
        dd = 0;
        for kk = 1: length(x)   % up to 500,000 iterations in this loop
            dist2 = (x(kk) - xi)^2 + (y(kk) - yi)^2;
            dd = dd + 1 / ( dist2 + fudge); % fudge is a scalar
        end
        dmap(ii+1,jj+1) = dd;
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And here it is with the changes I've already made to the innermost loop (which was the biggest drain on efficiency). This cuts the time from 65 seconds down to 12 seconds on my machine for the same test matrix, which is better but still far slower than I would like. 
<pre><code>     dmap = zeros(height, width);
    for ii = 0: height - 1
        yi = limits(3) + ii * deltay + deltay/2;
        for jj = 0 : width - 1
            xi = limits(1) + jj * deltax + deltax/2;
            dist2 = (x - xi) .^ 2 + (y - yi) .^ 2;
            dmap(ii + 1, jj + 1) = sum(1 ./ (dist2 + fudge));
        end
    end</pre></code>
So my main question, <strong>are there any further changes I can make to optimize this code?</strong> Or even an alternative method to approach the problem? I've considered using C++ or F# instead of MATLAB for this section of the program, and I may do so if I cannot get to a reasonable efficiency level with the MATLAB code.</p>

<p>Please also note that at this point I don't have ANY additional toolboxes, if I did then I know this would be trivial (using hist3 from the statistics toolbox for example).</p>

<p>Note: The GUI is to introduce parameters for a simulation in 5 tabs.

Besides, I have made the layout and callbacks on my own with the minimum amount of code and overhead. But, it still has very annoying tab transitions. </p>

785,785,1299858043.0,Stack Overflow,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5274998/enabling-option-key-shortcuts-in-matlab-for-mac,Enabling option-key shortcuts in MATLAB for Mac,"<p>Since R2009b, MATLAB has had marvelously customizable keyboard shortcuts through its <a href=""http://blogs.mathworks.com/desktop/2009/09/28/configurable-keyboard-shortcuts-have-arrived/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Keyboard Shortcuts Preferences</a>. This works very well for customizing shortcuts using command and control on a Mac.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those keybindings seem to be unable to override MATLAB's built-in character map. For example, if I define option-f as <code>cursor-next-word</code> (a la emacs), it accepts the binding. Hitting the key combination does properly move the cursor to the next word, but it additionally prints the <code>ƒ</code> character! I believe this is from the character map (perhaps as opposed to the input map?).  Neither <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24615-editormacro-assign-a-macro-to-a-keyboard-key-stroke-in-the-matlab-editor-and-command-window"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EditorMacro</a> nor <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25089"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KeyBindings</a> are able to override this behavior.</p>

<p>I stumbled across <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1759413/how-do-i-make-a-character-in-matlab/1786487#1786487"">this answer from a tangentially related question</a> which gives me hope. In short, he defined a Java class that can handle keyboard events and replace them with other keystroke input. The solution, however, only works as prescribed on Windows. The following modifications were required to run on a Mac:</p>

<p>I needed to change the keycodes to remap to have 'pressed' in the string, like so:</p>

<pre><code>map = {
    '$' '^'
    '#' char(181)  % might be useful for text formatting
};
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>map = {
    'alt pressed F' '^'
    'alt pressed B' char(181)  % might be useful for text formatting
};
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, after running the code, pressing option-f yields <code>cursor-next-word</code> and the <code>ƒ</code> character, just like before. However, if I disable the <code>cursor-next-word</code> binding from the preferences, then I get <strong>both</strong> <code>ƒ</code> and <code>^</code>! Indeed, even if I use a simple action like <code>pressed F</code>, the KeyReplacementAction doesn't replace the action but rather <em>augments</em> it. It seems like this behavior is unique to MATLAB on OS X.</p>

<p>It seems as though I'm simply not overriding the correct keymap. I've tried digging through the Java runtime, but I'm not familiar enough with the event dispatch model to know where to look next. Perhaps something within Java's OS-level keymap?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I've since done some more digging around. It appears as though the Mac version of MATLAB does not properly respect the 'consumed' property of a keyEvent. I can attach the KeyReplacementAction to either the <code>inputMap</code> or the <code>keymap</code>, and in both cases I augment the keybinding instead of replacing it. I used reflection to 'unprotect' the <code>consume()</code> method for AWTEvents, but the effect was the same as before.</p>

<p>Following the stack trace around, it appears as though the keyEvent is falling through to an instance of <code>javax.swing.KeyboardManager</code>. It looks like I should be able to unbind keystrokes within the KeyboardManager, but I cannot figure out how to access the instance from the MATLAB handles I have. Perhaps someone more familiar with Swing's event model and the Java debugger could get farther.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/36472/flolo"">flolo</a>'s answer spurred me to look into X11's keymaps. Several notes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Matlab does not seem to respect <code>~/.Xmodmap</code> or any currently-loaded modmaps. </li>
<li>Matlab makes use of the <code>$XKEYSYMDB</code> environment variable if it exists at startup. Otherwise, it loads it from <code>$MATLAB/X11/app-defaults/XKeysymDB</code>.</li>
<li>The whole <code>$MATLAB/X11/app-defaults/</code> directory looks very interesting; perhaps some hackery there could make this work?</li>
<li>Where <em>are</em> the X11 keymaps on a Mac? How does MATLAB switch to international keyboard layouts?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Hrm, I think X11 is a red herring. <code>lsof -c MATLAB</code> shows that it is accessing <code>/System/Library/Keyboard Layouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle</code>. Working on that now…</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: MATLAB does indeed use the system keyboard layout. I created one without any bindings as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/616736/r-m"">R.M.</a> suggested. This appeared to work — MATLAB does behave properly. Unfortunately, it also breaks my custom Cocoa keybindings in all other programs. Close, but no cigar. (Close enough, in fact, that R.M. won the +500 bounty due to a brief thought that it had worked… until I attempted to compose my congratulatory comment and discovered that I couldn't navigate the text field as usual.)</p>

We have our ups and downs, but for the most part our relationship has been strong.  Recently though we had a fight.  it started out simply enough.  I was asking her to do more, trying to be more experimental.  We brought things like sse, fast math, and unrolling into the bedroom and compiled new versions of our libraries. </p>

<p>It started out well enough.  We'd compile some code using the new libraries, test out the new waters.  Over time our performance as a couple soared.  She was working faster and I thought all was well and good.  Then things took a turn for the worse.  We brought another player into the mix.  Her name is Matlab.</p>

<p>We started compiling for Matlab,</p>

<pre><code>mex CC=""gcc"" CFLAGS=""\$CFLAGS -msse -msse2 -msse3 -ffast-math -ftree-vectorize"" LDFLAGS=""\$LDFLAGS -msse2 -msse3 -ffast-math -ftree-vectorize"" -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lsundials_cvode -lsundials_nvecserial -v -o kry_new.mexmaci64 mex_main.c

<p>compiling and linking worked great.   But then the trouble started:</p>

  2.0.0 or later, but libsundials_cvode.1.dylib provides version 1.0.0.
</code></pre>

<p>Matlab felt that our experiments had gone to far.  That they were totally different versions of the libraries.  I don't know where she got this idea.  I did some investigating:</p>

<pre><code>$ otool -L kry_new.mexmaci64 
kry_new.mexmaci64:

</code></pre>

<p>The problem was in libsundials_cvode.  There was no version 2, there never was.  To make matters worse, my Macbook took Matlab's side.  I tried uninstalling, striping out all references to the new things, even deleted our make files and tried to start again.  I tried to rebuild our libraries the old way.  But they wouldn't let go of the elusive version 2.  I didn't know how to give them what they wanted.  I just wasn't man enough to meet their expectations of me.</p>

<p>The only thing I could guess was that at some point, version 2 made sense, but that I backed away from it somehow.  I guess the link I had presented stayed in their minds even when I went back to the way it was.   I guess I forgot the first rule of that birds and the bees talk given by my sys admin, ""Every time you symbolink a dynamic library you give part of yourself away that you never get back.""</p>

<p>In desperation to keep both my Macbook and Matlab in my life, I told a lie that I'm not proud of:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv libsundials_cvode.1.0.0.dylib libsundials_cvode.2.0.0.dylib 
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't think it would work, but it did.  They compile my code now and they appear happy enough.  But I have the lingering feeling that I'm just faking it, and that my lie will come back to bite me.</p>

<p>So, since Dan Savage just ignores me, I turn to you stackoverflow for relationship advice. I need to somehow tell my Macbook that, no, version 1.0.0 is enough for us.  How can I get her to listen to me and fix the compatibility issues in my relationship without my horrible lie?</p>

This is mainly for my own curiosity so there is certainly no rush on answering this question, but if I see a solution that is very effective and very efficient, I may award a bounty so there is some incentive!</p>

<hr>

<h1>Main Question</h1>

<p>What is the most efficient way in MATLAB that you can think of that takes an image block / matrix and transforms it into a vector that conforms to zigzag ordering?  You can assume that the block is <strong>square</strong>, where the number of rows equals the number of columns.</p>

<h1>Some Background</h1>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Entropy_coding"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zigzag ordering</a> originally comes from the JPEG compression standard.  The basic steps behind the JPEG compression algorithm can be shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCa1h.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><sup>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></sup></p>

<p>To summarize, for an image, it is split up into 8 x 8 <strong>distinct</strong> image blocks, the 2D <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform"" rel=""noreferrer"">Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</a> is taken on each block, then <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Quantization"" rel=""noreferrer"">quantization</a> is performed on each block to allow for encoding that minimizes the total entropy of the bit sequence.  The most vital stage to this is the entropy encoding stage and is the last part of the algorithm.</p>

<p>Part of the entropy encoding stage involves <strong>zigzag ordering</strong> - The block is reordered into a 64 element vector in such a way where the most important frequency components from the DCT come first, followed by those components that don't really matter in order to reconstruct the block.  </p>

<p>Here is a pictorial representation of zigzag ordering on a 8 x 8 block:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OvhMb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><sup>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></sup></p>

<p>The blue arrow starts from the top-left or origin of the image.  Next, the direction that the arrow moves indicates how the 64 element vector needs to be populated with elements.  </p>

<p>Here is the basic algorithm for zigzag with reference to the above figure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start from the top-left of the block.</li>
<li>We move one space to the right, then downleft diagonally until we hit the image border.  </li>
<li>Once we hit an image border in Step #2, we move one space down, then move upright diagonally until we hit the image border.</li>
<li>Alternate between Steps #2 and #3 until we reach the bottom-right of the block.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a couple of corner cases you need to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Corner case #1 - If we are in Step #2, we hit the image border, and we are at the last column of the block, do <strong>not</strong> move one space to the right.  Move one space <strong>down</strong> instead.</li>
<li>Corner case #2 - If we are in Step #3, we hit the image border, and we are at the last row of the block, do <strong>not</strong> move one space down.  Move one space to the <strong>right</strong> instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once zigzag ordering occurs, any lossless compression algorithm, such as Huffman... and yes, even entropy encoding (as what this stage is named after) is performed on this reordered data.  These 64 element vectors are streamed to the compression algorithm and you thus have your compressed image.</p>

<h1>Back to the Problem Description</h1>

<p>You're probably seeing my dilemma now.  Because of the corner cases, I have not found an efficient way to do this without trying to do this with loops.  After doing some initial searching on the Internet, I have found a very similar post on <a href=""http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Zig-zag_matrix#MATLAB"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rosetta Code</a> that talks about creating a zig-zag matrix.  The goal here is to produce a matrix of size <code>M x M</code> where given an integer <code>M &gt; 0</code>, each location in the matrix is enumerated from <code>0</code> to <code>M^2 - 1</code> where the numbers are delineated in the order that the zig-zag ordering is performed and not as a single vector.  With some very simple modifications, you can solve the above problem, but I was wondering if there was any way to do this more efficient than loops.  If you check out the code, it's very unintuitive and doesn't make much sense unless you start displaying steps in the Command Window.  Even when this is the case, it's still pretty tough to understand, and I daresay obfuscated.</p>

<p>For self-containment, this is the ""reference"" code that implements zig-zag ordering with loops.  This was pulled off of Rosetta Code, but I modified it so that it conforms with the proposed problem.  This takes in a 2D square matrix <code>blk</code>, and <code>out</code> is a vector that produces the elements taken from the square matrix in zigzag ordering:</p>

<pre><code>function out = zigzag(blk)

    %This is very unintiutive. This algorithm parameterizes the
    %zig-zagging movement along the matrix indicies. The easiest way to see
    %what this algorithm does is to go through line-by-line and write out
    %what the algorithm does on a peace of paper. 

    [m,n] = size(blk);
    if m ~= n
        error('Not square');
    end

    out = zeros(numel(blk), 1);
    flipCol = true;
    flipRow = false;
    out(1) = blk(1);
    counter = 2;

    %This for loop does the top-diagonal of the matrix
    for i = (2:n)
        row = (1:i);
        column = (1:i);

        %Causes the zig-zagging. Without these conditionals, 
        %you would end up with a diagonal matrix. 
        %To see what happens, comment these conditionals out.         
        if flipCol
            column = fliplr(column);
            flipRow = true;
            flipCol = false;
        elseif flipRow
            row = fliplr(row);
            flipRow = false;
            flipCol = true;           
        end

        %Selects a diagonal of the zig-zag matrix and places the 
        %correct integer value in each index along that diagonal
        for j = (1:numel(row))
            out(counter) = blk(row(j),column(j));
            counter = counter + 1;
        end   
    end

    %This for loop does the bottom-diagonal of the matrix
    for i = (2:n)
        row = (i:n);
        column = (i:n);

        %Causes the zig-zagging. Without these conditionals, 
        %you would end up with a diagonal matrix. 
        %To see what happens comment these conditionals out. 
        if flipCol
            column = fliplr(column);
            flipRow = true;
            flipCol = false;
        elseif flipRow
            row = fliplr(row);
            flipRow = false;
            flipCol = true;           
        end

        %Selects a diagonal of the zig-zag matrix and places the 
        %correct integer value in each index along that diagonal
        for j = (1:numel(row))
            out(counter) = blk(row(j),column(j));
            counter = counter + 1;
        end   
    end


end

<p>While I was searching for this question I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1499749/list-of-1-indexed-programming-languages"">List of 1-indexed programming languages?</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(array)"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(array)</a> to be useful.</p>

<p>For me it is not a very convenient notation, maybe because I used to code in other languages before. But I still don't understand why MATLAB (and even Julia now) has a 1-based array indexing and what advantages it provides. Can anyone list out the advantages?</p>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding how the Euclidean distance transform function works in Scipy. From what I understand, it is different than the Matlab function (bwdist). As an example, for the input:</p>

<pre><code>[[ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]]
</code></pre>

<p>The scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt function returns the same array:</p>

<pre><code>[[ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]]
</code></pre>

<p>But the matlab function returns this:</p>

<pre><code>1.4142    1.0000    1.4142    2.2361    3.1623
1.0000         0    1.0000    2.0000    2.2361

As there is no built-in function for this, I am asking for the most efficient way to decode a sequence encoded in RLE.</p>

<h2>Specification:</h2>

<p>As to make this a fair comparison I would like to set up some specifications for the function:</p>

<ul>
<li>If optional second argument <code>values</code> of same length is specified, the output should be according to those values, otherwise just the values <code>1:length(runLengths)</code>.</li>
<li>Gracefully handle:

<ul>
<li>zeros in <code>runLengths</code></li>
<li><code>values</code> being a cell array.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Output vector should have same column/row format as <code>runLengths</code> </li>
</ul>

<p>
In short: The function should be equivalent to the following code:</p>

<pre><code>function V = runLengthDecode(runLengths, values)
[~,V] = histc(1:sum(runLengths), cumsum([1,runLengths(:).']));
if nargin&gt;1
    V = reshape(values(V), 1, []);
end
V = shiftdim(V, ~isrow(runLengths));
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Examples:</h2>

<p>Here are a few test cases </p>

<pre><code>runLengthDecode([0,1,0,2])
runLengthDecode([0,1,0,4], [1,2,4,5].')
runLengthDecode([0,1,0,2].', [10,20,30,40])
runLengthDecode([0,3,1,0], {'a','b',1,2})

<p>and their output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; runLengthDecode([0,1,0,2])
ans =

<p>For example, if <code>ndims(A)</code> is 6 and <code>d</code> is 3, then the expressions of the form </p>

<p>for <code>i</code> in <code>1:size(A, d)</code> represent all the slices (along dimension <code>d</code>) that make up <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>The problem with an expression like <code>A(:, :, i, :, :, :)</code> is that it cannot be generalized <em>symbolically</em> to slices along a dimension different from 3 in arrays having a number of dimensions different from 6.  E.g., to get <code>A</code>'s slices along dimension 2, one would need a different expression, <code>A(:, i, :, :, :, :)</code>.  This means that such expressions are useless in code that is agnostic about the shape of some array from which slices are to be extracted.</p>

<p>The function below is my matlab-noob attempt to implement shape-agnostic slicing.  (The name <code>slice</code> is already taken, hence I called the function <code>hslice</code>, short for <code>hyperslice</code>.)  The function's strategy is to reshape the input array into a suitable 3-d array, take the desired slice along the reshaped array's <em>second</em> dimension, and reshape the result to have the shape of a slice from the original input array.</p>

<pre><code>function out = hslice(ndarray, d, i)
    sz = size(ndarray);
    pfx = sz(1:d-1);    % dimensions before d
    sfx = sz(d+1:end);  % dimensions after d

    tmp = reshape(ndarray, prod(pfx), sz(d), prod(sfx));
    out = reshape(tmp(:, i, :), [pfx 1 sfx]);

Ideally I wold like to do this properly in matlab, but would also be happy with a solution in R. It seems like it should be possible but I can't for the life of me figure it out.</p>

<p>So generally, I would like to be able to set the alpha of an entire plotted object (i.e. of a matlab plot handle in matlab parlance...)</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ben.</p>

<p>EDIT: The data in the above example is actually 2D. The plotted points are from a computer simulation. Each point represents 'amplitude' (y-axis) (an emergent property specific to the simulation I'm running), plotted against 'performance' (x-axis). </p>

I will call these instances <code>MAT_1</code> and <code>MAT_2</code>. More specifically, the architecture of the system is:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>MAT_1</code> processes images sequentially, reading them one by one using <code>imread</code>, and outputs the result for each image using <code>imwrite</code>.</li>
<li><code>MAT_2</code> reads the images output by <code>MAT_1</code> using <code>imread</code> and outputs its result somewhere else.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the problems I think I need to address is to guarantee that <code>MAT_2</code> reads an image output by <code>MAT_1</code> once <code>MAT_1</code> has fully finished writing to it. </p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li>How would you approach this problem? Do I need to use semaphores or locks to prevent race conditions?</li>
<li>Does MATLAB provide any mechanism to lock files? (i.e. something similar to <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/en/man1/flock.1.html""><code>flock</code></a>, but provided by MATLAB directly, and that works on multiple platforms, e.g. Windows &amp; Linux). If not, do you know of any third-party library that I can use to build this mechanism in MATLAB?</li>
</ol>

<h3>EDIT :</h3>

<ul>
<li>As @yoda points out below, the Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT) allows for blocking calls between MATLAB workers, which is great. That said, I am particularly interested in solutions that do not require the PCT.</li>
<li><p>Why do I require <code>MAT_1</code> and <code>MAT_2</code> to run in parallel threads?:</p>

<p>The processing done in <code>MAT_2</code> is slower on average (and more prone to crashing) than <code>MAT_1</code>, and the output of <code>MAT_1</code> feeds other programs and processes (including human inspection) that do not need to wait for <code>MAT_2</code> to do its job. </p></li>

<p>I start an ipython session with no BLAS installed:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy.distutils.system_info as sysinfo
import time
In [11]: sysinfo.get_info('atlas')
Out[11]: {}

timeit( eig(randn(1E2,1E2)) )
100 loops, best of 3: 13.4 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>The same code in Matlab runs twice as fast</p>

<pre><code>tic,eig(randn(1E2));toc*1000
    6.5650   
</code></pre>

<p>I install the non-optimised ATAS deb from the Ubuntu repository. Re-start ipython and now I get:</p>

<pre><code>In [2]: sysinfo.get_info('atlas')
 ...
Out[2]: 
{'define_macros': [('ATLAS_INFO', '""\\""3.8.4\\""""')],
 'include_dirs': ['/usr/include/atlas'],
 'language': 'f77',
 'libraries': ['lapack', 'f77blas', 'cblas', 'atlas'],
 'library_dirs': ['/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas', '/usr/lib/atlas-base']}
</code></pre>

<p>And the test code:</p>

<pre><code>In [4]: timeit( eig(randn(1E2,1E2)) )
100 loops, best of 3: 16.8 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>So no faster. If anything a touch slower. But I haven't yet switched to the optimised BLAS. I follow these instructions: <a href=""http://danielnouri.org/notes/category/python/"">http://danielnouri.org/notes/category/python/</a> I build the libraries and overwrite the non-optimised versions with these. I re-start ipython but there's no change:</p>

<pre><code>In [4]: timeit( eig(randn(1E2,1E2)) )
100 loops, best of 3: 15.3 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Can't it get better than this? MATLAB is still twice as fast in this simple example. In a real-world example where I'm doing image registration in the Fourier domain, the Matlab equivalent is 4 to 5 times faster than the Python version. Has anyone managed to get Numpy working at MATLAB speeds?</p>

An important aspect of this is treating all variables as immutable, i.e. constants. In order to do so, many computations that would be implemented using loops in an imperative style have to be performed using recursion, which typically incurs a memory penalty due to the allocation a new stack frame for each function call. In the special case of a tail call (where the return value of a called function is immediately returned to the callee's caller), however, this penalty can be bypassed by a process called tail call optimization (in one method, this can be done by essentially replacing a call with a jmp after setting up the stack properly).

<p>I figure, since the storage now allows for it, that it should be possible to cast a complex-valued array to a real-valued array with twice as many elements, without copying the data.</p>

<p>MATLAB has a function <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/typecast.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>typecast</code></a>, which casts an array to a different type without copying data.

B = reshape(B,[2,sz]);      % reshape back to original shape, with a new first dimension

<p>The matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have (in R2018a and newer) the exact same data, in exactly the same order. However, to get to <code>B</code> we had to copy the data twice.</p>

<p>I tried creating a MEX-file that does this, but I don't see how to create a new array that references the data in the input array.

<ul>
<li>Is there anyway that I can speed up this calculation?  </li>
<li>Is there a better algorithm or implementation that I can be use to calculate the same values?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Describing the algorithm</h2>

<p>I have a complex indexing problem that I'm struggling to solve in an efficient way.</p>

<p>The goal is to calculate the matrix <code>w_prime</code> using values a combination of values from the equally sized matrices <code>w</code>, <code>dY</code>, and <code>dX</code>. </p>

<p>The value of <code>w_prime(i,j)</code> is calculated as <code>mean( w( indY &amp; indX ) )</code>, where <code>indY</code> and <code>indX</code> are the indices of <code>dY</code> and <code>dX</code> that are equal to <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> respectively.</p>

<p>Here's a simple implementation in matlab of an algorithm to compute <code>w_prime</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for i = 1:size(w_prime,1)
  indY = dY == i;
  for j = 1:size(w_prime,2)
    indX = dX == j; 
    w_prime(ind) = mean( w( indY &amp; indX ) );
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Performance Problems</h2>

<p>This implementation is sufficient in example case below; however, in my actual use case <code>w</code>, <code>dY</code>, <code>dX</code> are ~<code>3000x3000</code> and <code>w_prime</code> is ~<code>60X900</code>.  Meaning that each index calculation is happening on a ~9 million elements. Needless this implementation is too slow to be usable. Additionally I'll need to run this code a few dozen times.</p>

<h2>Example Calculation</h2>

<p>If I want to compute <code>w(1,1)</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the indices of <code>dY</code> that equal 1, save as <code>indY</code></li>
<li>Find the indices of <code>dX</code> that equal 1, save as <code>indX</code></li>
</ul>

<li>Find intersection of <code>indY</code> and <code>indX</code> save as <code>ind</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUQjX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Save the  <code>mean( w(ind) )</code>  to <code>w_prime(1,1)</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ykBpj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>General Problem Description</h2>

<p>I have a set points defined by two vectors <code>X</code>, and <code>T</code>, both are 1XN where N is ~3000. Additionally the values of X and T are integers bound by the intervals (1 60) and (1 900) respectively.  </p>

<p>The matrices <code>dX</code> and <code>dT</code>, are simply distance matrices, meaning that they contain the pairwise distances between the points. Ie <code>dx(i,j)</code> is equal <code>abs( x(i) - x(j) )</code>.</p>

<p>They are calculated using: <code>dx = pdist(x);</code></p>

<p>The matrix <code>w</code> can be thought of as a weight matrix that describes how much influence one point has on another.  </p>

<p>The purpose of calculating <code>w_prime(a,b)</code> is to determine the average weight between the sub-set of points that are separated by <code>a</code> in the <code>X</code> dimension and <code>b</code> in the <code>T</code> dimension.</p>

<p>This can be expressed as follows:</p>

This is the extension of my previous <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29587571/reading-mat-file-from-c-can-read-variable-but-cannot-return-properly"">question</a>.</p>

<p>In Matlab, I have used <strong><code>cell-structures</code></strong> which holds <strong><code>matrices (double) of variable sizes</code></strong>. Here is a toy example of what my *.mat file is <strong><code>supposed to store</code></strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Matlab Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>A = [[1 2 3]; [5 7 1]; [3 5 9]];
B = [[2 4];[5 7]];
Creator = 'DKumar';

nFilters = 2;

Filters{1} = [[-1.0 -1.0 -1.0]; [-1.0 8 -1.0]; [-1.0 -1.0 -1.0]];
Filters{2} = 2.0*[[-1.0 -1.0]; [-1.0 8]; [-1.0 -1.0]];

cd('/home/dkumar/CPP_ExampleCodes_DKU/Read_mat_File');
save('Test_FILE.mat', 'A', 'B', 'Creator', 'nFilters', 'Filters');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>C-code:</strong> The function <strong><code>""matread_Matrix"" reads matrices stored in *.mat properly</code></strong>. It's the function <strong><code>""matread_Cell""</code></strong>, which is supposed to read cell-structure, is <strong><code>not working</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a demonstration would help. Take the following vertices and faces to define a cube (lifted from the MATLAB documentation):</p>

<pre><code>vert = [0 0 0;1 0 0;1 1 0;0 1 0;0 0 1;1 0 1;1 1 1;0 1 1];

<p>And render it with the patch command, adding some colour information to the faces:</p>

<pre><code>patch('Vertices',vert,'Faces', fac, 'FaceVertexCData',hsv(8),'FaceColor','interp')
</code></pre>

<p>And view it in 3D:</p>

<pre><code>view(3)

<p>This gives a nice cube with interpolated colour values on the surface.</p>

<p>How to implement multi-class logistic regression classification algorithms via gradient descent in R? Can <code>optim()</code> be used when there are more than two labels?</p>

<p>So <code>X</code> is a matrix with 5,000 <em>examples</em>, each containing 400 <em>features</em>, which happen to be 400 pixels of a 20 x 20 image of a handwritten digit from 1 to 10, as for example this 9: </p>

<p>Applying a logistic regression algorithm to predict the handwritten number based on ""computer vision"" of the values in these 400 pixels presents the additional challenge of not being a binary decision. Optimizing the coefficients is unlikely to be efficient with an <em>ad hoc</em> gradient descent loop as in this <a href=""http://www.r-bloggers.com/linear-regression-by-gradient-descent/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">R-bloggers example</a>.</p>

<p>There is a nicely worked out example also in <a href=""http://www.r-bloggers.com/logistic-regression-with-r-step-by-step-implementation-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">R-bloggers</a> based on two explanatory variables (features) and a dichotomous outcome. The example uses the <code>optim()</code> R function, which is seems to be <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7920590/what-is-the-r-equivalent-of-matlabs-fminunc-function"">the way to go</a>.</p>

<p>Even though I have read the documentation, I am having problems setting up this more complex example, where we have to decide among 10 possible outcomes:</p>

<pre><code>    library(R.matlab)
    data &lt;- readMat('data.mat')

    X = data$X                 # These are the values for the pixels in all 5000 examples.
    y = data$y                 # These are the actual correct labels for each example.
    y = replace(y, y == 10, 0) # Replacing 10 with 0 for simplicity.

    # Defining the sigmoid function for logistic regression.
       sigmoid = function(z){
            1 / (1 + exp(-z))
       }

    X = cbind(rep(1, nrow(X)), X) # Adding an intercept or bias term (column of 1's).

    # Defining the regularized cost function parametrized by the coefficients.

       cost = function(theta){ 
           hypothesis = sigmoid(X%*%theta)
           # In ""J"" below we will need to have 10 columns of y:
           y = as.matrix(model.matrix(lm(y ~ as.factor(y))))
           m = nrow(y)
           lambda = 0.1
           # The regularized cost function is:
           J = (1/m) * sum(-y * log(hypothesis)  - (1 - y) * log(1 - hypothesis)) +
    (lambda/(2 * m)) * sum(theta[2:nrow(theta), 1]^2)
           J
        }

    no.pixels_plus1 = ncol(X)     # These are the columns of X plus the intercept.
    no.digits = length(unique(y)) # These are the number of labels (10).
    # coef matrix rows = no. of labels; cols = no. pixels plus intercept:
    theta_matrix = t(matrix(rep(0, no.digits*no.pixels_plus1), nrow = no.digits))
    cost(theta_matrix) # The initial cost:
    # [1] 0.6931472
    theta_optim = optim(par = theta_matrix, fn = cost) # This is the PROBLEM step!
</code></pre>

<p>Evidently this seems incomplete, and gives me the error message: </p>

<pre><code> Error in X %*% theta : non-conformable arguments 
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>X%*%theta_matrix</code> is carried out without any issues. So the problem has to be in the fact that I have 10 classifiers (0 to 9), and that I'm forced to create a matrix with 10 <code>y</code> column vectors to make the operations feasible with the function <code>cost</code>. It is possible that the solution goes through dummy-code the <code>y</code> vector with some line like: <code>y = as.matrix(model.matrix(lm(y ~ as.factor(y))))</code> as in my non-working code above, but yet again, I don't know that this encapsulates the ""one-versus-all"" idea - OK, probably not, and probably this is the issue. </p>

<p>Otherwise, it seems to work on the <a href=""http://www.r-bloggers.com/logistic-regression-with-r-step-by-step-implementation-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">R-bloggers post</a> with a binary classifier and extremely parallel to identical code.</p>

<p>So what is the right syntax for this problem? </p>

<p>Note that <a href=""https://github.com/RInterested/SIMULATIONS_and_PROOFS/blob/master/Gradient%20Descent%20in%20R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I have tried to work it out one digit against all others</a>, but I don't think that makes sense in terms of complexity.</p>

Note: This is the default keys for ""Evaluate Current Section"" in the editor.</p>

<p>See example code below:</p>

<pre><code>function test
  f = figure;  
  f.KeyPressFcn = @myKeyPressFcn;
end
function myKeyPressFcn ( hFig, event )
  cm = hFig.CurrentModifier();  
  if ~isempty ( cm )

  else 
    fprintf ( 'CurrentKey: %s\n', hFig.CurrentKey );
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>To reproduce save the above in an active file in the editor and run the function - the editor needs to be open (this is important!!).</p>

<p>With the figure active press any key -> the selected key is written to the terminal window.  However if you hold down Control and press the enter (return) key then this is not captured but instead Matlab attempts to ""Evaluate Current Section"" (or cell as it used to be called) in the editor (no matter that the figure has the focus).  This of course throws as error...</p>

<p><em>I have contacted Matlab support and this is ""expected behaviour!"".  I can (just about) see why it might be a good idea for demos - but for professional applications that run in Matlab I personally think this ""feature"" is a bug!!</em></p>

<p>Notes</p>

<ol>
<li>When the editor is closed the control+enter is captured in the figure</li>
<li>In deployed applications the control+enter is captured.</li>
<li>If I manually change the Evaluate Current Section shortcut then control+enter is captured.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have tried a number of things to resolve this but none have worked, for example hiding the editor or setting editor enable state to false (neither of these are acceptable solutions - I was trying to see what I could get to work on a small test case...):</p>

<pre><code>function test
  desktop = com.mathworks.mde.desk.MLDesktop.getInstance;
  jEditor = desktop.getGroupContainer('Editor').getTopLevelAncestor;
  jEditor.setVisible(false);
  jEditor.setEnable(false);
  f = figure
  f.KeyPressFcn = @myKeyPressFcn;
  uiwait(f);
  jEditor.setVisible(true);
  jEditor.setEnable(true);
end
</code></pre>

<p>The only way I can get it to work is to close all of the editor files on launching the GUI and then opening them again when the GUI closes (this is not an acceptable solution... - for fairly obvious reasons!!)</p>

<p>I did think about trying to temporarily modify the shortcut key (Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts) of the ""Evaluate Current Section"" -> but haven't worked out a way to do it from the commandline, and then set it back again when finished.  If this is fast you could do it when the user presses and releases the control key.</p>

<p>So what am I asking:</p>

<p>If possible I need a solution that will work for anyone anywhere - as if I can get this to work it will be included in a new add-on feature in <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/matpihome/matlab-gui-framework"" rel=""noreferrer"">my Matlab GUI Toolbox</a>. - which is used by people all over the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you know how to modify the keyboard shortcuts from the commandline - if so how!</li>
<li>Any other suggestions?</li>
<li>My other idea is to change my shortcut to a different key combination - but wheres the fun in that! :)   (I will still have the issue if some user somewhere has altered the execute the current cell to my new combination...)</li>

<p>I am trying to understand what exactly the convPart variable is doing and what pooledFeaturesThis. Secondly I notice that my problem is a mismatch in this line <code>pooledFeaturesTrain(featureStart:featureEnd, :, :, :) = pooledFeaturesThis;</code>
where I got the message that the variables is mismatching. THe size of pooledFeaturesThis is 100x3x2x2 where the size of pooledFeaturesTrain is 400x8862x2x2. What exactly pooledFeaturesTrain represents? Is the 2x2 result for every filter?

This gives possible regions of interest where an object might be. I want to do some processing and retain only some of the regions, and then remove duplicate bounding boxes to have a final neat collection of bounding boxes. To discard unwanted/duplicated bounding boxes regions, I'm using the <code>grouprectangles</code> function of opencv for pruning.</p>

<p>Once I get the interesting regions from Matlab from the ""selective search algorithm"" in the link above, I save the results in a <code>.mat</code> file and then retrieve them in a python program, like this:</p>

<pre><code> import scipy.io as sio
 inboxes = sio.loadmat('C:\\PATH_TO_MATFILE.mat')
 candidates = np.array(inboxes['boxes'])
 # candidates is 4 x N array with each row describing a bounding box like this: 
 # [rowBegin colBegin rowEnd colEnd]
 # Now I will process the candidates and retain only those regions that are interesting
 found = [] # This is the list in which I will retain what's interesting
 for win in candidates: 
     # doing some processing here, and if some condition is met, then retain it:
     found.append(win)

# Now I want to store only the interesting regions, stored in 'found', 
# and prune unnecessary bounding boxes

boxes = cv2.groupRectangles(found, 1, 2) # But I get an error here

<p>The error is:</p>

<p>What's wrong?
I did something very similar in another piece of code which gave no errors. This was the error-free code:</p>

<pre><code>inboxes = sio.loadmat('C:\\PATH_TO_MY_FILE\\boxes.mat')
boxes = np.array(inboxes['boxes'])
pruned_boxes = cv2.groupRectangles(boxes.tolist(), 100, 300)

%note: h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) will be a column vector with K rows.

<p>I'm having problems with the nested sums, the bias nodes, and the general complexity of this equation. I'm also struggling because there are 2 matrices of weights, one connecting the inputs to the hidden layer, and one connecting the hidden layer to the outputs. Here's my attempt so far.</p>

<p>Define variables</p>

I got two surfaces and a plane in the same figure.
I want to use different colormap and colorbar for b and another colormap and colorbar for c. s is fixed color so it's not a problem.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain what I am trying to achieve:</p>

<p><strong>cmap1=colormap(topobathy)</strong> -->cmap1 is 64x3 double as expected</p>

<p><strong>cmap2=colormap(redwhitegreen)</strong></p>

<p>create cdata1 using cmap1 (this is the first part I cannot figure out, how to scale z data using cmap1, by default CData contains the z values)</p>

<p><strong>b=surf(x,y,z,cdata1)</strong></p>

<p><strong>colorbar</strong> for b using z values</p>

<p><strong>c=pcolor(x,y,(z-z0))</strong> - I want to use cmap2 for this one.</p>

<p><strong>colorbar</strong> for c using (z-z0) values</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far and the problems I encounter</p>

<pre><code>b=surf(x,y,z);
colormap(topobathy);
cbar1=colorbar;
set(get(cbar1,'ylabel'),'String', 'Elevation (m)', 'Rotation', 90)
hold on;
s=surf(x,y,z1,'FaceColor',[0.278 0.788 0.788])
hold on;
change=z-z0;     
c=pcolor(x,y,change)
set(c,'ZData',100 + 0*change); %plotting it above the other surfaces
colormap(redwhitegreen)`
</code></pre>

<p>at this point colormap is set to redwhitegreen for b, colorbar of b 
I can't get the second colorbar with its own clim etc.</p>

963,963,1396456908.0,Stack Overflow,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22817806/best-practice-when-working-with-sparse-matrices,Best practice when working with sparse matrices,"<p>This question is based on a discussion in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22789128/matlab-indexing-sparse-matrix"">this question</a>. I have been working with sparse matrices earlier and my belief is that the way I've been working with these is efficient. </p>

<p>My question is twofold:</p>

<p>In the below, <code>A = full(S)</code> where <code>S</code> is a sparse matrix. </p>

<h1>What's the ""correct"" way to access an element in a sparse matrix?</h1>

<p>That is, what would the sparse equivalent to <code>var = A(row, col)</code> be? </p>

<p><strong>My view on this topic:</strong> You wouldn't do anything different. <code>var = S(row, col)</code> is as efficient as it gets. I have been challenged on this with the explanation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accessing element on row 2 and column 2 the way you said, S(2,2) does
  the same as adding a new element: <code>var = S(2,2)</code> => <code>A = full(S)</code> =>
  <code>var = A(2,2)</code> => <code>S = sparse(A) =&gt; 4</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can this statement really be correct?</p>

<h1>What's the ""correct"" way to add elements to a sparse matrix?</h1>

<p>That is, what would the sparse equivalent of <code>A(row, col) = var</code> be? (Assuming <code>A(row, col) == 0</code> to begin with)</p>

<p>It is known that simply doing <code>A(row, col) = var</code> is slow for large sparse matrices. From <a href=""http://www.mathworks.se/help/matlab/math/accessing-sparse-matrices.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you wanted to change a value in this matrix, you might be tempted
  to use the same indexing:</p>
  
  <p>B(3,1) = 42; % This code does work, however, it is slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My view on this topic:</strong> When working with sparse matrices, you often start with the vectors and use them to create the matrix this way: <code>S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n)</code>. Of course, you could also have created it like this: <code>S = sparse(A)</code> or <code>sprand(m,n,density)</code> or something similar.</p>

<p>If you start of the first way, you would simply do:</p>

<pre><code>i = [i; new_i];
j = [j; new_j];
s = [s; new_s];
S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n); 
</code></pre>

<p>If you started out not having the vectors, you would do the same thing, but use <a href=""http://www.mathworks.se/help/matlab/ref/find.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>find</code></a> first:</p>

<pre><code>[i, j, s] = find(S);
i = [i; new_i];
j = [j; new_j];
s = [s; new_s];
S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n); 
</code></pre>

<p>Now you would of course have the vectors, and can reuse them if you're doing this operation several times. It would however be better to add all new elements at once, and not do the above in a loop, because <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/781410/appending-a-vector-to-an-empty-matlab-matrix"">growing vectors are slow</a>. In this case, <code>new_i</code>, <code>new_j</code> and <code>new_s</code> will be vectors corresponding to the new elements.</p>

<p>For instance, the static path contains an old copy of the google-collections.jar, which has long been supplanted by Google's guava library and which has some of the same class names (e.g. com.google.common.base.Objects).

<p>Also <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/sparse-matrix-operations.html"">its documentation</a> verifies the efficiency of sparse matrix transposition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To do this (accessing row by row), you can transpose the matrix, perform operations on the columns, and then retranspose the result … The time required to transpose the matrix is negligible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow-up (modified as suggested by @Mikhail):</p>

<p>I agree with @Roger and @Milhail that setting a flag is enough for many operations such as the BLAS or sparse BLAS operations in terms of their interfaces. But it appears to me that Matlab does ""actual"" transposition. For example, I have a sparse matrix X with size m*n=7984*12411, and I want to scale each column and each row:</p>

<pre><code>% scaling each column
t = 0;
for i = 1 : 1000
    A = X; t0 = tic;
    A = bsxfun(@times, A, rand(1,n));
    t = t + toc(t0);
end
</code></pre>

<p>t = 0.023636 seconds</p>

<pre><code>% scaling each row
t = 0;
for i = 1 : 1000
    A = X; t0 = tic;
    A = bsxfun(@times, A, rand(m,1));
    t = t + toc(t0);
end
</code></pre>

<p>t = 138.3586 seconds</p>

<pre><code>% scaling each row by transposing X and transforming back
t = 0;
for i = 1 : 1000
    A = X; t0 = tic;
    A = A'; A = bsxfun(@times, A, rand(1,m)); A = A';
    t = t + toc(t0);
end
</code></pre>

<p>t = 19.5433 seconds</p>

<p>This result means that accessing column by column is faster than accessing row by row. It makes sense because sparse matrices are stored column by column. So the only reason for the fast speed of column scaling of X' should be that X is actually transposed to X' instead of setting a flag.</p>

<p>Also, if every sparse matrix is stored in CSC format, simply setting a flag cannot make X' in CSC format.</p>

<p>Any comments? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Here is сomparison of existing Matlab datatypes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Matrix</strong> is very fast, hovewer, it has no built-in indexing labels/enumerations for its dimensions, and you can't always remember variable name by column index.</li>
<li><strong>Table</strong> has very bad performance, especially when reading individual rows/columns in a for loop (I suppose it runs some slow convertion methods, and is designed to be more Excel-like).</li>
<li><strong>Scalar structure</strong> (structure of column arrays) datatype - fast column-wise access to variables as vectors, but slow row-wise conversion to observations.</li>
<li><strong>Nonscalar structure</strong> (array of structures) - fast row-wise access to observations as vectors, but slow column-wise conversion to variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wonder if I can use some simpler and optimized version of Table data type, if I want just to combine row-number and column-variable indexing with only numerical variables -OR- any variable type.</p>

<p>I have a struct array <code>S</code> with a certain field, say, <code>bar</code>, and I want to pass all the <code>bar</code> values to my anonymous function <code>foo</code>. Since the number of elements in struct <code>S</code> is unknown, <code>foo</code> must be able to accept a variable number of arguments.</p>

<p>The closest thing that I've been able to come up with is passing a cell array as the input argument list:</p>

<p>and I'm invoking it with <code>foo({S.bar})</code>, but it looks very awkward.</p>
